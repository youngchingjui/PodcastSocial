Amir Adnani, CEO of Uranium Energy and chairman of GoldMining, joins me today to talk uranium and  gold [13:41].  You may be aware that President Trump will make his decision on  Section 232 by July 15. This is a major petition that could force utility companies to buy uranium from U.S.-based producers… And Amir gives his prediction on what Trump will do. Next… the yellow metal has been on a tear, breaking through the $1,400 level for the first time in six years. Amir breaks down the gold markets… where gold is going… and how he’s positioning GoldMining to be one of the biggest beneficiaries. On a final note… I recently flew back to Florida from New York and, well, it didn’t go as planned…   Get ready for a classic rant. -------------------------------- Editor’s note: With the crypto market on a tear, we’ve had a crazy amount of renewed interest in our Curzio Equity Owners (CEO) token. It gives accredited investors a stake in our fast-growing business… and it’s one of the few ways to gain exposure to the multibillion-dollar financial publishing industry. If you’re interested, don’t wait—the offering closes July 15.

			<description><![CDATA[Dr. Mark Skousen, free market economist, financial advisor, professor, and award-winning editor of Forecasts & Strategies, joins me today for an incredible, wide-ranging interview [13:02]. He gives us his take on current economic conditions… three macro events he believes could derail our bull market… and some of his favorite income ideas today. Dr. Skousen is a legend in the financial newsletter industry and best-selling author of  over 25 books. He’s lectured in over 70 countries and taught economics and finance at numerous colleges, including Columbia Business School. He’s also producer of the annual FreedomFest, “the world’s largest gathering of free minds.” (I’m honored to be speaking at the festival next month in Vegas.) We discuss FreedomFest and reminisce about the old days in the financial newsletter industry—back when you had to actually stuff envelopes.     In my educational segment [48:16], I pound the table—once again—on an investing strategy anyone can use… and how it helped us close out another big winner in Curzio Venture Opportunities. -------------------- Editor’s note: Curzio Venture Opportunities subscribers had the chance to bank 110% on another small-cap growth stock this week—the fourth triple-digit winner since the launch of the service— thanks to the incredibly powerful strategy Frank explains on the show.

			<description><![CDATA[How many times will the press blow up a story with hand-wringing and fear-mongering and 24/7 coverage… only to drop it like a hot potato at the start of the next news cycle? Take Zika for example… The mosquito-borne virus causes mild (if any) symptoms, but it’s been linked to birth defects. And when the 2016 Summer Olympics were held in Rio de Janeiro, many athletes (and spectators) didn’t go due to widespread fears over the virus. Fast forward to today. There’s no epidemic… no panic… and no story. It’s no different with the constant headlines about tariffs… Except I’m going to tell you when (and why) to buy stocks on tariff news! Trust me… This is even better than a drinking game. I welcome back John Petrides, managing director and portfolio manager at Point View Wealth Management [19:38]. We cover an array of topics and, of course, John breaks down his favorite sectors and the stocks he likes right now. And you don’t want to miss my educational segment [48:41]. I divulge an investing secret—a lesson I’ve learned over my long career. This isn’t something you’ll read about in any books… but it’ll help you become a better investor for the long term. -------------------------------- P.S. I just released an incredible new report for  Curzio Research Advisory members. If you’re not yet a member, keep an eye on your inbox for how to access this name… It’s a tiny new company testing a game-changing device that could send the stock soaring 1,000% or more. And don’t miss the wild footage of me trying out the device.

Nevada isn’t your typical junior mining company... Today you’ll hear its incredible story [15:31] and the amazing potential of its gold discovery technology.  Dennis also highlights the risks the company faces and its next steps in searching for large gold deposits. And… if you haven’t heard, we’ve hit our soft cap goal of $3 million for the Curzio Equity Owners digital security. The response has been incredible, and I’m so grateful to those of you who’ve chosen to invest with us so far. Tomorrow, I’m heading to New York to conduct meetings with potential investors in my network. I talk about this and provide other updates on our STO offering. In today’s education segment [43:41], I answer a great question about one of my recent biotech recommendations. It’s a fantastic teachable moment... ---------------- P.S. We’ve passed our soft cap goal for CEO. It’s not too late to participate in the growth of Curzio Research… But our private sale does end tomorrow. On Friday, I’m opening up the offering to outsiders… And once we hit our hard cap, I have to close the offering.

Leave it to me to head north, from Florida, when it’s supposed to snow several inches! I don’t have a guest for you this week, but don’t worry. This podcast is full of useful information... especially if you’re worried about your portfolio.    Today, I explain why this economy is great for stocks. Not too hot, not too cold... just right. Walmart reported one of its best holiday quarters in years. I explain what its earnings results say about the economy. An old portfolio holding was in the headlines yesterday... Navient, the student loan provider, rejected a buyout offer for $12.50 per share. I explain why Navient is worth much, much more than this takeover bid. Thank you to all who have invested in our Curzio Research security token offering to date. I’m truly humbled by your belief in this company and what we have to offer. I update you today on how the first week is going... and our plan to grow this business into one of the largest indecent financial newsletters in the country.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I’ve been talking a lot about how digital securities will disrupt numerous industries. This includes investment banks, stock exchanges, crowdfunding, and royalty companies. And you can now add residential real estate to that list. My guest today is Matthew Sullivan, a seasoned veteran in corporate finance. He’s worked for Sir Richard Branson’s corporate finance team—and is the co-founder of a $50 million secured real estate income strategies fund, QuantumRE. Sullivan has found a way to use digital securities (tokens) to access the trillions in equity sitting in U.S. homes. The best part? American homeowners can tap this equity without taking on any more debt. Trust me when I say this interview will blow your mind. We’re in the heart of earnings season, with over 30% of companies posting Q4 results. In my educational segment [43:18], I break down the numbers and share where I’m seeing a lot of great investing ideas. I also talk about China… the Fed… and this one thing that worries me right now.]]></description>

The interest was overwhelming… And that’s no surprise since "tokenization" will become a trillion-dollar industry inside of five years. But it wasn’t all about tokenization at VRIC… Today, I break down the rest of the conference for you, including some amazing technologies... I give you an inside look at the meetings with industry insiders… and I share my three favorite junior mining ideas with huge upside potential. I also welcome first-time guest Clare Flynn Levy, founder and CEO of Essentia Analytics, which provides behavioral analytics (coaching) for portfolio managers with billions in assets under management. Clare isn’t just a data specialist… She’s a former portfolio manager, former hedge fund manager, and award-winning tech analyst. Clare’s goal is to make everyone a better investor by using data to limit mistakes—and increase returns—during extreme volatile times... when our emotions can sometimes get the best of us.  The data she shares will blow you away]]></description>

I hope you followed along on Twitter as I fought my way through 180,000 people to give you exclusive access to the 4,500 companies presenting their most cutting-edge products and ideas… I kick off today’s podcast with a macro view of the show. This week, a $10 billion deal was announced between major gold producers. To go over the details of this mega-merger, I welcome back Marin Katusa, founder and CEO of Katusa Research and one of the biggest industry insiders in the  mining space. We also discuss the significant implications this deal will have on segments within the gold sector… including junior miners, mid-tier miners, and royalty companies. Next week I’ll be speaking at the  Vancouver Resource Investment Conference (VRIC). Marin explains how you can attend this incredible event for free. And in my educational segment [53:29], I give you even more detail on the biggest trends I saw at CES. I’m talking about artificial intelligence (A.I.), self-driving cars, 3D printing, smart cities, smart homes, 5G, and more. Grab a pen… I go over the companies that’ll benefit most from these enormous trends—and tell you which ones to avoid.]]></description>

Once you listen to this segment… you’ll understand why this industry is in dire need of change!   Lastly… I tell you how to get into some of the best STOs—many of which come with discounts—over the next year.

Right now, we’re seeing 300 point moves in the Dow Jones index on daily basis… and some of the greatest companies in the world are down more than 30% from their highs.    During volatile markets, it’s vital to have tools in place to lower your overall risk. After all, the last thing you want is to take a 70% loss on any position. And by limiting your losses, you have some dry powder to buy incredible names at significant discounts. In this special podcast, I break down one of the most important lessons in investing—risk management. Few people know more about this topic than Dr. Richard Smith, founder and CEO of TradeSmith. On today’s show, Dr. Smith, who has a PhD in math and systems science, breaks down his favorite risk management techniques… and his strategy to take emotions out of investing. This interview is a must-listen. Then in my educational segment (55:00), I do the unimaginable... I break down one of my biggest losers of the year. We’ll have losing investments from time to time… but today I show you how I was able to avoid a catastrophic loss for investors by using this one simple risk management technique.   It’s a great lesson on how to become a better investor. And I’m sure you’ll enjoy listening to me eat some humble pie!  Wishing you all a very happy holiday!]]></description>

It’s also the company we’ve partnered with to help with the upcoming launch of our Curzio Equity Owners (CEO) security token offering.  Carlos explains why digital assets will be a multitrillion-dollar market—a must-listen for anyone looking to learn more about security tokens… the recent trends taking place within this space… and how to generate potentially life-changing returns in this incredible growth industry.    Speaking of trillion-dollar opportunities… I just booked my ticket to The Consumer Electronics Show (CES).

On today’s podcast, I share my secrets to finding some of the greatest tech trends before they go mainstream. This includes Big Data, artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), cloud, virtual reality (VR), smart cities, and more…   As these megatrends unfold, I’ll also show you how to find the companies with the most upside potential. ]]></description>

All it takes is a few volatile days… then crazy headlines start predicting the market will crash another 40%... or another credit crisis. But the recent pullback is just that—a pullback… A healthy correction… A normal part of the markets for over a century. And when you look at the underlying fundamentals... the market isn’t expensive. In fact, a lot of names are screaming buys.   My guest today is Jay Martin, president and CEO of Cambridge House International (CHI)... home to some of the best investment conferences in North America. CHI made its name as the leader in hosting the best junior mining conferences in Canada. Over the past few years, it branched out to hosting conferences in other sectors, including technology, innovation, and alternative investments.  Jay highlights some incredible early-stage trends that should be on everyone’s radar. And he gives you all the details about CHI… including the upcoming Silver and Gold Summit, October 28–29 in San Francisco. Not only will I be attending… I’ll be speaking on a few occasions. If you’re there, be sure to stop by and say hello. In my educational segment [36:12] I share details on something extraordinary we’re doing at Curzio Research. You don’t want to miss this segment… as investors will have the opportunity to participate directly in the growth of our company.   ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Earnings season kicks off next week… So I invited John Petrides of Point View Wealth Management back today to tell us what to expect. I love having John on the show because of his wealth of knowledge across many different sectors. He’s one of the best analysts I know when it comes to breaking down earnings from macro and micro perspectives. And we’re likely to see incredible volatility in many stocks during the season. Since last quarter, we’ve seen an uptick in energy prices and wages—two of the biggest costs for companies. The U.S. dollar has also run higher, which could cut into profits for companies that do business overseas. And increased tensions between the U.S. and China on trade could cause further inflationary headwinds. These risks create a huge layer of uncertainty for management teams… which could lead to less-than-optimistic forecasts when they report earnings results over the next few weeks. And earnings forecasts (guidance) are what drives stock prices. Today, John shares a list of stocks every investor should pay close attention to during earnings season. These companies will give you a great perspective on the global markets and how to position your portfolio. He also highlights some of his favorite names heading into earnings season… including two you should purchase right now.     In my educational segment [52:38], I explain a strategy that’s helped me buy industry-leading companies at an incredible discount to the market… and generate huge profits over my 25-year career. This low-risk/high reward strategy can be used by anyone… but it requires discipline and courage… which is why most investors will never try it.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I’ve got a very special guest for you today. It’s his first appearance on this podcast, and I’m truly honored to have him on. Over the past 30 years, he’s made a small fortune financing, creating, and selling junior mining companies. His name is Dennis Higgs. And he’s a legend in the resource sector. If you’ve never heard of him, I’m not surprised. He avoids the media and rarely does interviews at all. He’d rather let his record speak for him. But today, Dennis breaks his silence to talk about the gold industry… where prices are headed… and the catalysts that will push it to those levels over the next six to 12 months.  More importantly, Dennis shares his new venture with us. It’s a junior mining company that’s using new technology to find high-grade gold deposits in the world’s biggest gold district. He’s chairman and director of this company—where he and other insiders own a huge 36% stake. Then, in my educational segment [41:24] I break down the latest news on Tesla. I’m not going to tell you where the stock is headed—since there are literally hundreds of places to get opinions on this volatile company…   But I will talk about why Tesla soared this week…   And how you can apply this indicator to other stocks for incredible short-term gains.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[On today’s podcast, I welcome back hedge fund veteran Mike Alkin to talk about this incredible bull market... some concerns that could derail it... and why Tesla could pull back considerably over the next three to six months. You may know Mike as editor of  Moneyflow Trader here at Curzio Research and host of the fantastic Monday podcast, Talking Stocks Over a Beer. But Mike's also a forensic accountant. His reasons for shorting Tesla go beyond what you’ll read in mainstream media… making this interview a must-listen. In my educational segment [1:00:35], I talk about a country that’s on my radar for the first time in over 10 years. It’s dirt cheap and starting to see huge growth—evident in an important economic indicator, which I'll explain today—along with how to make money from it. Note: What’s going on between the U.S. and China is one of the most important stories in the world right now—especially for investors. Next week, you're invited to take part in a free event covering the ins and outs of what’s going on… the effects it will likely have on the markets… and exactly how you should be positioning yourself to reap the rewards. On today's show, I mentioned a special report I put together to get you started. It sets the story straight on tariffs… and gives you a leg up on everyone else.

To find the best investment opportunities, Kim’s traveled to more than 80 countries over his 25-year-plus career.   Kim travels to China often—and speaks directly to local business folks and large institutions. He starts our show by breaking down the latest drama on tariffs… And why the situation between China and the U.S. is different from what you’ll see in the media. Later in the interview, Kim shares some details from his latest trip—to a dirt-cheap country most people would never think of investing in… filled with huge growth potential. Kim also reveals some of his favorite investment ideas. This includes three international stock picks U.S. investors can add to their portfolio today. (These names were even new to me!)     Then in my educational segment [52:27], I break down the one “Trump Card” China holds that could crush the U.S. when it comes to tariffs. If China takes this initiative… one small sector will surge in value, creating life-changing returns for investors. Trust me, you’ll want to pay close attention.  Note: I’ve put together a free report exposing the real story behind Trump’s tariffs… and how investors can take advantage of the new policies.  Click here to get your free copy.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the families that will be impacted by this terrible event. Please be safe! Today I welcome back Chris Versace, co-founder and chief investment officer of Tematica Research. He’s an amazing stock analyst with over 20 years of experience. Chris is also a good friend. We worked together at The Street over 10 years ago. He has an incredible track record for finding great stock ideas ahead of Wall Street.   In this interview, Chris explains the easiest way for individual investors to find those ideas. He also shares several of his favorite picks… so be sure to have a pen and paper handy. Then, in my educational segment [48:26], I break down a sector most believe is dying a slow death. But fears have been blown out of proportion… giving you a great opportunity to buy these stocks at an incredibly cheap price.   Note: I suggest paying close attention to Chris Versace’s stock recommendations. The last time I interviewed a member from his team was in late June. She mentioned a stock idea that’s up about 60% in just over two months.  This is just one of the expert picks we’re tracking in the Wall Street Unplugged All-Star Portfolio.

As you might expect, we cover a number of topics—from China and the tariff headlines to Andrew’s take on emerging markets… and whether that pullback is a buying opportunity or a flashing caution sign. Andrew also shares the U.S. economic indicators he’s watching… and why the market is positioned for a pullback over the next few months. And of course he gives us a lot of great investing ideas.  Note:  My guests and I often discuss 5 to 10 stocks in a single episode… And that’s just while we’re on-air.  When we’re chatting off-air, more often than not another stock or two is mentioned.

Van is internationally known and respected… and he’s been investing in rare coins since the 1970s. He helped create The Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS), which is credited with bringing accountability to this “alternative investment class.” Van gives us an insider perspective on everything from rare coins to sports memorabilia. If you’ve never had an interest in collectibles… trust me, you will after hearing this incredible interview.   In my educational segment [106:47], I explain why now is a good time to look at diversifying your portfolio… And I share some great tips for doing so. Note: As I mentioned on today’s show, some of the most incredible stock ideas I’ve heard from my guests come out in conversations “off-air.”  So I created  this to get you in the room while the mics are off.

			<description><![CDATA[If you want to increase your overall return on investment, today’s show is a must-listen. But you have to be willing to venture where other investors fear to go… and try unconventional ideas. My guest is Chris Mayer, editor of Bonner Private Portfolio, an investment research service from Bonner & Partners. Chris is an incredible stock analyst with over 20 years’ experience. He always provides unique investment insight during our interviews. And, based on your feedback, he’s one of my most popular guests. Chris shares two of his favorite sectors to invest in… which are completely off Wall Street’s radar… and highlights several names within these sectors you should be buying right now. He also explains why you need to “mix it up” when it comes to investment philosophy. He provides a great example of a unique strategy he used to generate exceptional returns on an industry-leading stock—even though sales and earnings were declining. Then in my educational segment [57:00], I break down a strategy that will sound absolutely crazy—it flies in the face of almost every investment book you’ll ever read. But it’s one of my favorite ways to make incredible returns in one of the most volatile sectors in the world...    ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Today I welcome back a 40-year market veteran... and one of my favorite bears: Rich Suttmeier. Rich is an incredible analyst. He’s also founder and CEO of Global Market Consultants, with great insight on a variety of topics. He breaks down Turkey’s financial crisis… why it’s significant to individual investors… and how it could be the catalyst that pops a $270 trillion debt bubble. While Rich tends to land on the bearish side, he’s been bullish on FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) for quite some time. He explains why he’s now changing his tune on these tech giants. We also cover the banking sector. Rich highlights several measures banks are using right now to stick it to Main Street. He and I have passionate debates about this sector… so you’re in for some fantastic entertainment and a solid education. Then I break down earnings season in my educational segment [42:35]. On the surface, earnings and sales growth may look positive… but there are significant risks most investors and analysts are overlooking—risks that could push stocks significantly lower over the next six months. As always, I share all the details and numbers to back up this claim… and explain the steps you can take to protect yourself.]]></description>

He’s also one of the smartest biotech analysts, covering the industry for over 15 years. In this interview, Marc talks about the latest change he’s seeing in investor sentiment. This includes tons of investors who are worried about the market crashing over the next six months. Marc breaks down the current short-term risk he sees in the market… and what sectors to buy if the market pulls back. He also discusses why investors with a long-term investment horizon shouldn’t be concerned with predicting major moves in the stock market. As always, Marc gives us a couple of his favorite ideas to consider right now. This includes two names with revolutionary technology that isn’t being talked about much in the media. Then in my educational segment, I break down a great strategy I use to make money in one of the most volatile sectors. It’s responsible for some of my biggest winners over the past decade.

			<description><![CDATA[If you believe the markets will pull back over the next 18 months… after eight straight years of moving higher… then this podcast is an absolute must-listen.   My guest today is Mike Alkin, editor of Moneyflow Trader here at Curzio Research. This unique newsletter teaches individual investors how to conservatively bet against stocks. Mike already gave listeners numerous winners on past Wall Street Unplugged episodes… including Dean Foods, Newell Brands, and Goodyear Tire. He explained why these companies would fall in value. If you shorted them, you’d have made more than 30% on average. But if you used Mike’s simple strategy—where your risk is limited but your upside is limitless—you’d have made more than 3x returns on each of these picks. In this episode, Mike talks more about this amazing strategy. He explains why picking stocks that’ll move lower over the next 12 months is like shooting fish in a barrel right now. And he shares two more picks that are likely to get crushed over the next few months… which could lead to big returns for investors. Mike also breaks down the one market he loves right now. It’s a super-depressed sector that has nowhere to go but up. Listen… and find out exactly how to play it.  ]]></description>

Chris is one of my most popular guests for a reason. His breadth of knowledge on stocks, bonds, commodities, and world events is incredible. Instead of specializing in one asset class, Chris specializes in finding price anomalies… and predicting where the big money is moving. Right now, Chris believes we have the opportunity to make a small fortune from one hated sector—one that will boom as European countries build up their militaries in preparation for war… Trust me… you won’t want to miss this episode. Note: Right now, Chris is offering Curzio Research investors an exclusive opportunity to invest alongside him in the resource sector. This will include “private placement” deals all over the world. However, you must be an accredited investor to participate… and this exclusive offer ends Sunday. To learn more about his new venture,  click here.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Happy 4th of July! This is a special holiday for me. It brings back great childhood memories of our summer house in upstate  New York. That’s where my late dad put on a firework display that would put most professional displays to shame. I hope all of you enjoy time with your family. Drink a few beers, tell some great stories, and enjoy the barbecue. When you’re done, you’ll love my interview this week. I welcome back Hugh Agro, a superstar in the mining industry. Hugh is President and CEO of Revival Gold, a company I introduced you to six months ago on this podcast. The company just reported blockbuster drilling results at its flagship project, Beartrack. It’s a game changer—which is why the stock is one of the best-performing junior mining companies over the past 12 months. Hugh talks about these drilling results… and highlights why he’s buying more shares of his company right now. He also explains why gold prices are close to a bottom—and are likely to move much higher over the next 24 months. It’s an interview you don’t want to miss. Finally, in my educational segment… I break down a controversial investing strategy that’s almost guaranteed to make you money. It’s also likely to make a lot of listeners angry... since this secret is known to destroy people’s lives.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Pullbacks in the markets can be disconcerting… but recent activity is perfectly normal. As I’ll explain, it’s actually healthy when stocks pull back gradually… and based on the current fundamental and economic landscape, I suggest using this pullback as a buying opportunity. I also welcome Lenore Hawkins, 20-year market veteran and chief macro strategist at Tematica Research. Lenore breaks down the biggest market risks for investors... including rising interest rates and the looming potential for trade wars. Plus, she shares her favorite tech trend... and how investors can still make money on it. Finally, I break down the recent ruling by the Supreme Court to allow states to legalize gambling, creating a lucrative new $44 billion market. Following this landmark decision, I highlight stocks that will be the biggest winners―and losers―in that sector.  ]]></description>

He suggests buying a popular commodity instead… which he largely avoided for the past decade.   Marin is one of the best resource investors I know. And although he’s bearish on gold in the short-term, we discuss why that’s a positive for us as investors.   Marin also explains what to look for when evaluating a resource investment (it takes more than just a great discovery...) and how to scale into the best names over time.   This is an incredible interview with a lot of great information.

I know from experience how difficult it is not to let personal feelings impact your investing… but we’ll discuss why it’s critical that you don’t.   And in our education segment, I show you what’s hiding deep inside the numbers from Apple’s recent earnings call.]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to Wall Street Unplugged. Today, everyone is talking about the 10-year Treasury yield—namely, how it just broke 3% for the first time in years. Here’s the truth: this isn’t a big deal—no matter what the media say. This number is still well below historical norms… However, it does present us with a buying opportunity… which I’ll tell you about in today’s show. But before I get to that, I welcome as my guest this week Danielle DiMartino Booth. Danielle is a former adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and editor of the Money Strong newsletter. Today, she breaks down the impact higher yields will have on individual investors… the fundamental landscape of today’s housing market… and why millennials will be a huge drag on the economy much quicker than most economists are forecasting. I also give you a play-by-play of how I find my best stock ideas. This simple strategy will help you invest in the best stocks before Wall Street finds out about them… and before they’re mentioned in the media.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Ignore the crazy headlines… In this episode, we talk about how to use the media’s “agenda” to pocket huge gains in stocks. Most headlines are exaggerated. They include phrases like “market crash” and “trade wars.” It doesn’t matter. The market is flat this year and America is not in a trade war with any nation… The media exaggerates these headlines to get page views. That’s how they make money. Yet these headlines (including tweets from our president) can temporarily influence stocks, causing disconnects between a company’s fundamentals and stock price. Smart investors can use these disconnects to invest in some of the world’s greatest companies – like Amazon or Facebook – at incredible discounts. Also in this episode, we breakdown the best banking stock to own right now (it’s not JP Morgan)… and why one major airline will see its stock price rise much higher from here.     SHOWNOTES: 0:42 - Long time listener Joe thanks me for my insight on the oil market and asked if he should invest in small or large caps. 5:22 - When you should jump into the oil market... and who is carrying the market. 13:23 - Listener Derrick: Since when is there a maintenance fee on your Curzio Research Advisory Lifetime membership? 13:58 - How the Lifetime membership subscription works. 24:15 - Listener Dave: How much attention should investors give to employee engagements and potential unionization attempts? 35:03 - Ten-year listener Doug asks whether he should keep his money in a current stock pick I recommended a while back. 40:35 - I’ll be launching a product that’s new to the industry… It will include a weekly new pick. 41:20 Be sure to like our Facebook page.

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to Wall Street Unplugged. My guest this week is Corby Marshall, CEO of Hilltop Cybersecurity. (Full disclosure: I’m an early investor in this company.) Corby joins me from the RSA cybersecurity conference to discuss what we should all be thinking about it when it comes to protecting our data. You’ll also be fascinated to hear what led him to into this space... Later, we’ll talk about how important it is to look beyond the headlines when it comes to evaluating a stock. Read the story no one else is telling—because news stories aren’t often digging into the fundamentals. I also take a few moments to vent about the media’s obsession with the Mark Zuckerberg Facebook hearings and the James Comey publicity book tour.      0:33 –  Why did we make such a big deal about the Mark Zuckerberg hearings on CNBC? 4:20 - Can we trust the biggest companies in a space to regulate their own industry? 6:35 - I watched James Comey’s latest PR blitz for his book trashing the President. 9:18 - Democrats need to stop lingering on this Russia collusion nonsense. 10:33 - Netflix reported good numbers, but of course, someone always goes on TV and says they’re worried about the company’s expenses… I’m not. 14:24 - So excited that we are into earnings season. 16:25 - Seeing a lot of potential in cybersecurity, so I’m also excited to be chatting with Corby Marshall, CEO of Hilltop cybersecurity. 19:20 - Corby’s background and why he got into cybersecurity. 21:42 - What are the latest trends in cybersecurity he’s seeing at the RSA conference? 24:02 - How vulnerable are normal people online? 27:04 - The formation of Hilltop and how it strives to be better than the competition. 30:35 - What scares Corby the most. 33:19 - How important is it to have a great team. 37:18 - Hilltop’s involvement in the cryptocurrency space and protecting its customers. 40:45 - Connecting with Corby at the Hilltop website 45:24 - Cancel newsletters where their editors aren’t allowed to buy stocks. 46:55 - It’s not whether or not a stock is expensive, it’s about its growth potential. 48:45 - Find the story that no one else is talking about. 50:44 - For example, how I looked at the defense sector during sequester talks back in 2012. 52:34 - Another example, big pharma and the patent cliff that people were worried about.]]></description>

I can’t stress this enough: I care about and what happens to your portfolio.   The reason you listen to me, subscribe to the newsletters, and read our research is so you can focus on your life and take advantage of our “stock brains” here at Curzio Research. On this episode, we talk about what it means to have a stock brain. And we touch on other programs offering financial advice. If you follow other podcasts and tv personalities that give stock recs, make sure they care about what happens to you. There are plenty of people who give out financial advice... but many don’t think about how those calls will impact real people like you.   SHOWNOTES: 0:57 – Listener Shawn asks all of you in the Curzio Research community to keep the Humble Broncos hockey team in your thoughts and prayers following the tragic bus crash in Canada. 4:19 - Listener feedback from Chris regarding my recent commentary on hedge funds and what can happen to your money in poor-performing funds. 6:55 - I notice that the hedge fund managers that go on TV have had declining performance. 13:09 - Listener question from John: Should we be listening to and following the folks on CNBC’s FastMoney? 15:20 - You have to follow the people that actually care about you and your money. 23:08 - Listener question from Chris: I think I have a stock brain. Is that normal? 27:35 - I take you through my stock brain when I read a headline, listen to a conference call, or analyze a company. 30:45 - Check out Thursday’s  Wall Street Unplugged on why I don’t believe stocks will crash. 34:54 - Make sure you like our Facebook page for more live videos we’re producing.]]></description>

Even though Mike writes his newsletter for Curzio Research, he and I often have differing views on the markets. (Mike is bearish and I’m more of a bull.) Even so, we generally find common ground. I have a lot of respect for his knowledge and opinions. Today, Mike reviews how he analyzes stock news and what helps him decide whether a company is going to have success in the future. Then in my educational segment [50:15], I talk market risk factors. The media is hyping three main risks right now: rising inflation, rising interest rates, and a potential trade war. All of these things have investors running for the hills. But the truth is, they’re not the negative market forces the headlines are making them out to be. Listen to find out why...

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to Frankly Speaking. There are a lot of myths surrounding hedge funds, particularly how much yield they create vs. how much it costs you to invest in them. Today I debunk some of those myths, and remind you of the risks vs. rewards of hedge funds. Remember, the better they do, the more risk they take with your money. I also discuss some big changes coming to Curzio Research. We’re getting ready to unveil some exciting new products… and share some special offers with our subscribers. On today’s episode, I also stress the importance of ignoring the market noise. Brexit... tariffs... it doesn’t matter. You can always ride these waves with proper portfolio management. SHOWNOTES: 0:51 – Listener question from Max: Are we seeing a fundamental shift in the hedge fund industry? 4:26 - Hedge fund pricing 9:10 - Hedge funds are encouraged to take more risk with your money. 19:09 - Listener questions from Kurt: Is Briefing.com a substitute for those who can’t afford Capital IQ? Will Curzio Research bundle products? 27:20 - Listener feedback from Jack: I stopped out of one of our Curzio stocks.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome back to Frankly Speaking. There are a lot of myths surrounding hedge funds, particularly how much yield they create vs. how much it costs you to invest in them. Today I debunk some of those myths, and remind you of the risks vs. rewards of hedge funds. Remember, the better they do, the more risk they take with your money. I also discuss some big changes coming to Curzio Research. We’re getting ready to unveil some exciting new products… and share some special offers with our subscribers. On today’s episode, I also stress the importance of ignoring the market noise. Brexit... tariffs... it doesn’t matter. You can always ride these waves with proper portfolio management. SHOWNOTES: 0:51 – Listener question from Max: Are we seeing a fundamental shift in the hedge fund industry? 4:26 - Hedge fund pricing 9:10 - Hedge funds are encouraged to take more risk with your money. 19:09 - Listener questions from Kurt: Is Briefing.com a substitute for those who can’t afford Capital IQ? Will Curzio Research bundle products? 27:20 - Listener feedback from Jack: I stopped out of one of our Curzio stocks. Should I keep it on the radar for a future position?   30:24 - Ignoring market noise 31:25 - Portfolio management 35:43 - Listener question from Bruce: If returns on REITs are so high, why isn’t everyone flocking to them? What’s the catch?]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[I’m so excited to bring on analyst Barry Cohen to talk all things cryptocurrency and blockchain. Barry explains how these technologies work, how you can secure cryptocurrencies safely and easily, how the regulatory landscape is going to change, and more. All of this comes ahead of the cryptocurrency newsletter we’re launching in May. Make sure you subscribe to our free email list now to be the first to know about this product when it’s launched. I get a little heated over negative news about Amazon and complaints that it’s ruined businesses across the country—especially when the complaint comes from a company that did its own share of putting others out of business: Walmart. Meanwhile, other folks are complaining that Amazon has an unfair advantage due to its relationship with the United States Postal Service. Today, I explain why the USPS needs Amazon, despite arguments that the postal service is getting the losing end of the deal. I know some of you might be panicking about the scary trade wars talk and how it’s impacted the market. I’ll tell you why we won’t have a trade war... and why tariffs on goods coming into the United States are actually a good thing.   While stocks have declined on those fears, there a few great investing opportunities I’ll tell you about today...  Stocks Mentioned  Amazon Walmart T-Mobile Whole Foods Goldman Sachs Microsoft Apple Facebook Under Armour Tesla   SHOWNOTES 0:33 – I’m so annoyed when I see someone who has the same opinion as the president rail against him because of partisan politics.   1:25 - Lina Khan of the Open Markets Institute. 6:45 - Trump’s tweets against Amazon are a complete joke; Amazon is saving USPS. 10:07 - Walmart has no business complaining about Amazon. 14:24 - Don’t worry about tariffs pushing the markets down; we're not getting into a trade war. 16:52 - Excited for our guest today, Barry Cohen. 19:30 - Correlation between the cryptomarket and Wall Street. 22:38 - Will cryptocurrencies always move in the same direction? 27:26 - Why Barry is excited about cryptocurrencies. 30:51 - Why regulation is needed for cryptocurrencies. 36:00 - How does someone go about buying cryptocurrencies? 38:44 - Kraken and Coinbase. 42:13 - The different types of cryptocurrency exchanges. 45:33 - How ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) work. 50:02 - What subscribers can expect from the crypto newsletter we’re getting ready to launch in May. 58:06 - Mike Alkin product (reopening to new subscribers soon). 1:00:48 - Education segment: The markets are getting hit hard because of exaggerated concerns over the supposed trade war. 1:06:58 - Opportunities in the market right now. 1:17:40 - Thank you again for all of your love and support for my daughter. 1:18:15 - New videos on the Curzio Research Facebook page.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to Wall Street Unplugged. I have an incredible show for you today... I don't read many newsletters, but I always make a make a point to read Vigilante Investor, edited by today’s guest Steve Koomar. Unlike many newsletter writers, Steve always backs up his thesis with hard facts, and I learn something new from every issue. Steve and I discuss all the negative headlines about Trump’s new tariffs—propelling fears of a trade war that could ultimately hurt the U.S. Like myself, Steve believes these news stories have it wrong. On today’s episode, we break down why. And you won’t believe Steve’s expectations for stock market returns over the next several years... He explains how the recent tax cuts, combined with deregulation, will lead to the kind of economic expansion we haven’t seen since the New Deal. And one of the best bull markets in a generation. Later on, in my educational segment [52:00], you’ll learn how the NCAA men's basketball tournament can help you improve your investing game. It doesn’t matter if you’re not a sports fan; today’s segment will make anyone a better investor. Good investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[March Madness is upon us! As many of you know, college basketball is my favorite sport. Today, I kick off the show by breaking down the brackets and sharing my predictions for who will make the Final Four. But even if you’re not a sports fan, you’ll want to stay tuned, because later on, I interview the brilliant Marin Katusa, founder of Katusa Research. Marin is a good friend of mine and a regular guest of the podcast. He also happens to be one of the best analyst in the resource sector. Today, Marin shares his thoughts on the current environment for gold, and how long he thinks it’ll be until institutional investors start putting their money back into gold stocks. We also discuss a bull market in a commodity that almost nobody is noticing. Marin explains the catalyst behind this bull market, and he shares what he believes could be a takeover target. Then, in my educational segment (48:30), I tell you everything you need to know about the new steel and aluminum tariffs. It’s time to put your “political hat” aside because just about everyone has it wrong when it comes to tariffs. I explain why in today’s episode. Good investing Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Today, we’re going to tackle some of the biggest issues on every investor’s mind: inflation and a potential trade war. First, we’ll consult with John Petrides of Point View Wealth Management. I try to have John on the show at least once a quarter, because he’s incredibly knowledgeable on all areas of the market. John tells us how inflation (specifically, rising wages) could affect stock prices—and why he isn’t worried about an impending “trade war.” He also shares the sectors he likes today... and a few of his favorite stock ideas. Next, I welcome my good friend and 40-year stock market veteran Richard Suttmeier [41:00].   Rich is the best analyst I know when it comes to the federal budget. He explains how the Fed is trying to “unwind” its balance sheet… how its actions could hurt Main Street… and what to expect over the next 12 months.   Rich also reveals which assets he currently likes and which he doesn’t––including one “safe” asset that could soon roll over. Click here to listen. Good investing, Frank Curzio  ]]></description>

Marc is Chief Income Strategist at the Oxford Club… Senior Editor of the Oxford Income Letter… an expert on the biotech sector… and an all-around amazing analyst. Marc and I chat about his new book, You Don’t Have to Drive an Uber in Retirement. The book shares money-making ideas for retirement that don’t require working a job you hate. Marc recently attended the JP Morgan Healthcare conference (the Who’s Who of Healthcare conferences). Listen closely as Marc shares some of his favorite picks from the conference… and tells us what to look for before investing in a biotech stock. You’ll also hear some of Mark’s favorite income stock ideas. Then, in my educational segment [42:42], I share two of my favorite tools for finding little-known investment ideas. The best part is... anyone can use them. Good investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

Back in high school, when most kids barely knew what a stock was, Chris was trading futures. Recently, he shifted his focus from the equity markets to cryptocurrencies… what he claims is “probably the best decision I ever made.” For the first time, Chris says, we have true currency competition… It’s an exciting moment in history. You’ll learn why Chris thinks everyone should have money allocated to cryptocurrencies... his “Five Phase Cycle” for investing in cryptos… and the safest way to store them. Over the next couple of weeks, big retailers report earnings. In my educational segment [42:40], I’ll give you a game plan for how to invest in this sector. We’ll also discuss why Wal-Mart dropped 10%... and why you should have seen this pullback coming... Good investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

Nate is an entrepreneur, professional cryptocurrency trader, and leads a crypto-trading Facebook page with 80,000 active monthly members. Nate and I discuss crypto volatility… and why trading cryptocurrencies is more about technical analysis than fundamental analysis. You’ll also hear about the new project Nathan is working on… and his passion to educate new crypto investors. But most importantly... Nathan shares what we should be focused on when trading cryptos (hint: it’s not just what cryptocurrency to buy...). And be sure to stick around for my educational segment (39:00). I explain why—despite what you’re hearing from most talking heads—the market is not expensive… and where you’ll find amazing research you can use for free.

			<description><![CDATA[Join Mike Alkin for the maiden voyage of The Mike Alkin Show--Talking Stocks Over a Beer! In this episode, you’ll hear about an industry where the risk/reward ratio is one of the best available anywhere. As Mike interviews Jordan Trimble, CEO of Skyharbour Resources, you‘ll discover the state of the uranium market today… The trigger that set off a major bear market in uranium... And why the market is about to move much higher very quickly. You’ll learn… How uranium exploration companies have survived a major bear market… Why global demand is increasing… the nations that are driving demand… and why there is tremendous upward price elasticity that could send prices soaring. Jordan exposes the false narrative about uranium demand and shares the truth (it’s the opposite of what you hear through the rumor mill)... Where the richest uranium deposits in the world are located... The forces that have created a uranium deficit—even with secondary uranium supplies— which will take uranium prices to new heights... How major uranium miners are forcing prices higher... A major IPO that is also pushing prices up... How changes to public commodities markets are adding momentum to upward price action... Why a $50 spot price is a very realistic expectation—and how that will create parabolic growth for equity investors... Why ”grade is king” when it comes to uranium—and where you find the highest grade uranium in the world… How Skyharbour is using drones to improve the ability to discover new uranium deposits… and a unique new mining technique that will drive extraction costs down… ease permitting requirements… and minimize environmental impact… And how that could drive improved returns for equity investors. Skyharbour’s growth plans for the next 6 months, including its specific financial situation and exit strategy... Plus, how it plans to take advantage of the macroeconomic shifts occurring today… And what investors might expect from the company as a result. Finally, Mike wraps up with an educational segment in which he shares a surprising nugget of wisdom: Why “mom & pop investors” have a big advantage over professional investors… and exactly what actions you should take to win against the pros. There’s a ton of wisdom packed into today’s episode—so be sure to listen closely!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The Eagles are world champions! As many of you know, I’m a diehard Philadelphia Eagles fan. I had an amazing time at the Super Bowl this year – it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. To see a few video highlights from the event, check out our Facebook page here. But I’m back with two great interviews for you today… On this episode, I explain why prudent investors love corrections. The market has seen an intra-year correction (10% pullback from its highs) for 37 straight years. Over 75% of the time, the market ended the year higher. You’ll also hear from two amazing guests: First up… Mike Alkin, Editor of Moneyflow Trader. Mike tells us what he’s seeing in the markets (hint: we have different opinions!)... and explains how to profit from a further pullback in stocks. We also get a sneak peak into Mike’s new podcast… (details below). Then I chat with first-time guest, Gianni Kovacevic – author of My Electrician Drives A Porsche. Gianni is one of the leading authorities on electricity analysis. He drove a Tesla across the U.S. to prove the “technology of the future” is here now. You’ll learn why electricity demand is about to skyrocket all over the globe… and Gianni’s favorite way to profit from this global trend…  Tune in to listen to these all-star analysts. Good investing, Frank Curzio  P.S. Our own Mike Alkin is going to be hosting his own podcast, the "Mike Alkin Show: Talking Stocks Over a Beer." We'll be rolling it out soon, but Mike had something urgent to say… so he couldn't sit on it until then. Stay tuned for his timely pre-episode tomorrow.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. This week I sit down with a mining rockstar… Hugh Argo, CEO of Revival Gold. Hugh has an incredible track record. And a unique combination of skills… He had a successful career in investment banking before he became a mining engineer. Before joining Revival Gold, Hugh helped transform a $1.7 billion gold company to a $17 billion company. Today, Hugh and I discuss a key catalyst for higher gold prices: Gold producers are running out of deposits to mine. And we'll tell you how to profit from the shortage... Hugh also shares his unique vision for a mine that returns cash to shareholders... explains his company’s flagship project... and why his management team is everything an investor could want. You'll also hear about my favorite indicator for rising gold prices...  And what it's telling us today. Good investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

If you’ve been listening to my podcasts over the past several months – you'll already know how excited I am about this. Ron and I first met in June 2016 when Marin Katusa, Doug Casey, and I booked a trip to Alaska to tour Northern Dynasty’s world-famous Pebble project – the largest undeveloped gold and copper mine on the planet. As most junior resource investors know, there's been a lot of buzz around this project. But it's been a wild ride for shareholders… Ron and his team have been faced with strong headwinds over the past year, thanks to the EPA... And after a long and overdue settlement, Ron has finally decided to break his silence… On today’s episode, Ron talks about the history of the popular Pebble mine… how his company managed to overcome the EPA dispute… and reveals an exciting new partnership… Good investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[“Don’t confuse a brand you know for a company you should own...” - Mike Alkin Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. This week’s guest is Mike Alkin – Curzio Research’s newest Senior Analyst and Editor of—I can finally say it—Moneyflow Trader. On today’s show, you asked — we answer. Mike and I go over the questions you posted we didn’t get to answer on this week’s video training series… while giving you a hefty sneak peek at what’s ahead for Moneyflow Trader. Topics and questions covered on the show include:  Mike’s bearish and bullish sectors of 2018 A mini masterclass on how to think about risk… both from a macro perspective, and for each individual position you hold. The art of the exit, and the age-old question of when to sell And the very personal reasons Mike left the hedge fund world to start a newsletter for "little guy" investors like us...  As we approach a tipping point in today’s eight-year bull market, don’t miss out on what this hedge-fund vet has to say about the so-called S&P 500 and 401k “safe” plays. You heard it here first. Good investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

But this information is dated - showing only positions fund managers purchased over the past 3 months. They may not even be in these stocks anymore.

			<description><![CDATA[For uranium investors, the long wait for a rebound may finally be over… Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. Since Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011, uranium producers have battled one of the worst bear markets in the commodity’s history. Amid tough market conditions, uranium has been the only commodity where not a single mine can turn a significant profit. But in a major development announced just last week, producers have finally responded in a BIG way – pushing prices higher for the first time in years. On today’s episode, uranium expert and CEO of Skyharbour Resources, Jordan Trimble, breaks down the magnitude of this announcement – and what it means for the entire uranium market going forward… He also catches listeners up to date on Skyharbour Resources – one of the few remaining uranium exploration companies in the world. If you’re sitting on uranium stocks… or interested in what could be an enormous opportunity for gains in this sector… I suggest listening to this episode right away. Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

Questions & Comments:  “Nice rant on wednesday. Seems like every week one of my stocks is getting trashed by these short reports. I’m not sure which firms are legit and which ones are the short scammers… hard to know which short sellers to trust when everything seems so manipulated. I’d like to know if you’re in my corner.” • Wade [00:50]  “Frank, I decided that listening to your podcast was a waste of time given the amount of time you spend ranting about sports (bashing baseball mostly). I have stopped listening and have turned my attention elsewhere.” • Grant [08:30]  “I’ve never seen a more wild earnings season for individual stocks than we’re having over the past few months. A handful of stocks on my watchlist are up or down more than 20% just today! Plus, at an index level - it’s the lowest volatility on record. Something has got to give?” • Erold [13:27]   “My question is on Alterra Power (AXY). I’ve been a shareholder since before the reverse split. Now that it’s known it’s going to sell for $8.25 per share (because they’re getting bought out), and it’s currently $7.70 per share - Would it make sense to buy under the sell price before the sell date?” • Jonathan [24:33]]]></description>

Chris is one of my all-time favorites… A continual world traveler, I often call Chris the “Anthony Bourdain of finance.” His boots-on-the-ground research uncovers frontier investment ideas you’ll hear nowhere else. Last time Chris was on the show (April, 2017), he revealed five stock ideas. And today, ALL five of those stocks are well into the green – three are up over 20%. Tune in this week to hear what other ideas Chris has in store for us… including a few tips and tricks to avoid the mainstream financial nonsense we’re faced with everyday. Plus, get a sneak peek of his upcoming book, How Do You Know?, which highlights the misguided attitudes that can destroy a portfolio. Good Investing, Frank Curzio P.S. For this week’s Educational Segment [51:58], I break down one of my newest bets in the semiconductor space. For the first time in at least 10 years, this large-cap name is finally ahead of the innovation curve… and it’s still dirt-cheap.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This week I sit down with legendary Texas wildcatter and CEO of Chisholm Exploration, Cactus Schroeder. Cactus is one of the smartest men you’ll find in the oil business. For 40 years, he's drilled around the most prominent basins of North America. And he's consulted on or invested in over 1,000 drilling projects. Cactus was featured on Discovery Channel’s Wildcatters – a television series that followed three people searching for oil and gas in areas other than oil fields. He's also credited with finding one of the largest oil-producing wells in the Eagle Ford – which he later sold to Norway’s Statoil for north of $1 billion. If you own any oil stocks, or thinking of jumping back into oil any plays, be sure to tune into this interview first... Cactus tells us where he thinks oil prices are heading... and the risks to consider today when placing your bets in this space. More importantly, he updates listeners on the breakeven prices needed to drill in the Permian, the Bakken, and the Eagle Ford… and why these “strike zone” numbers are vital to oil producers and investors going forward. Good Investing, Frank Curzio P.S. On this week’s Educational Segment we’ll discuss a trade Marin Katusa recommended last week. If you took action, you’d be up 60% in just four trading sessions. It's another example why sometimes – especially during this volatile earnings season – you just have to stick to your guns.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Why I’m still long on General Electric (despite its recent slump)… Bruno Mars is NOT Michael Jackson… Eagles to the SuperBowl? On today’s episode of Frankly Speaking, I mostly cover General Electric (GE). I’ve received tons of questions and emails after shares reached a new 52-week low last week. So I wanted to give my followers an update. A massive restructuring is currently underway and rumors are spurting in every direction. In addition, JPMorgan is now saying a dividend cut is “likely”… which could push prices even lower. This is a name I’ve been wrong on for the past six months… But, with my ego put aside, I still think GE is an incredible buy at these levels. Here’s my take. As always, thanks to everyone who participated!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. Today I have an exclusive interview for you with Jeff Phillips, President of Global Market Development. If you haven't heard of Jeff, that's likely because he rarely gives interviews. But he's one of the most trusted names in the resource industry – like frequent guest and close friend, Marin Katusa. After financing over 100 different resource companies, Jeff has developed a unique approach to investing in this highly volatile sector. He’s helped me and my listeners generate a ton of money over the years. And he could do the same for you today... In this 30 minute interview, Jeff reveals…  Why today’s resource bear market may finally coming off its bottoms. His current investment thesis for the gold, uranium, and rare-earth metal industries. And the names of four junior miners he believes are “buys” right now...  Don't miss what he has to say. Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

Richard is an expert at analyzing what he calls "the balance sheet of the U.S. economy," otherwise known as the FDIC Banking Profile. Using this hard data, which most investors tend to overlook, Rich gives us his economic forecast… More specifically, he dives into the recently released U.S. home sales data… and why the housing market may be due for a correction within the next 6 to 12 months.

			<description><![CDATA[Today we welcome back Frank Holmes, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of U.S. Global Investors. Under his 25-plus years of leadership, U.S. Global Investors has launched several funds, including the first-ever airliner ETF (JETS), and most recently, the U.S.Global Go Gold fund (GOAU). Since its June launch, GOAU has outperformed every major index within the gold industry. In this episode, Frank reveals his unique “moneyball” approach – explaining the quantitative tricks traditional funds are completely ignoring… And he shares the names of the three companies he considers the “safest and least volatile” in the entire mining industry. Then Frank and I talk cryptocurrencies... As Frank explains today, digital currencies and the blockchain aren't just a passing trend. They're a revolution. We’re on the verge of a market disruption the likes of which we haven't seen since the launch of Amazon and Google. Tune in to learn the best way to catch this wave – while you still can...]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[“There are two certainties when it comes to resource investing…”   On today’s episode of Wall Street Unplugged, we unveil a junior miner that's molded its entire business model around these two certainties… and how to profit from them.   The first certainty you probably know:   The resource market is cyclical.   When supply and demand imbalances occur, the resource sector is slow to react. This lengthy lag time creates massive price swings incomparable to other markets.   The second certainty, on the other hand, is not so obvious...   When bear markets occur, the majors significantly underinvest in new assets.   As commodity prices fall into bear markets, the major players in the industry (the multi-billion dollar mining firms) fail to do what they’re typically good at…   Buying resources.   Instead, these firms go into "protection mode." They stop investing in new projects... cut exploration costs… and primarily maintain their balance sheets. Some, depending on the bite of the bear, even brace for bankruptcy.   This phenomena is one of the most overlooked certainties in the industry today.   From my experience, only a handful of miners truly take advantage of these certainties…   When a bear cycle hits, they pick up fantastic assets for pennies on the dollar.   With the help of today's WSU guest and mining expert, Amir Adnani, I'll be breaking down one of these companies.   As the price of gold slowly but surely begins to crawl back, insiders have picked up about 25% of the company with their own capital.   More importantly, with roughly 19 million ounces of gold in the ground drilled at just $8/ounce, this particular miner is in a league of it’s own.   It's one of the most underappreciated gold miners today…   And one of the best investment ideas I've ever given my listeners.   Good Investing,   Frank Curzio   P.S. After Amir signs off, we’re jumping into an Educational Segment. Outside of FAANG, the underlying market is becoming dangerously volatile – with numbers I haven’t seen since the credit crisis. For short-term speculators, this segment will tell how to place your next bet… without catching a falling knife.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Today's guest is Managing Director at Point View Wealth Management and one of Wall Street Unplugged’s finest, John Petrides. Wall Street benchmarks and sectors are shaking up amid recent fears of North Korea and our nation's ongoing hurricane misfortunes. And as these two major current events develop, John and I discuss where investors should be playing their cards… In other news, the Russell 1000 growth index (IWF) is up over 17% year to date... while the Russell 1000 value index (IWD) has gained 3% since January. Is it finally time to stop chasing growth? Tune in as John breaks down what it takes to be a true value investor. A stock could be down 30... even 50%, but forget it. As John explains, that doesn’t matter. When it comes to value investing, there’s  only one question we must ask ourselves. John then talks Apple. He's one of the few analysts I know that has been dead-right on the stock in recent years. And his analysis couldn’t come at a better time... Apple is set to launch the highly anticipated iPhone 8 in just a couple weeks. John's the type of guest that can bring the conversation in any direction. And today – from geopolitics, oil, and the consumer staples sector to M&A's and mutual funds – he it covers it all. These are conversations you don’t want to miss.

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged.   For many investors, Amazon's Whole Foods acquisition was the death knell for brick and mortar retail…   This week, Steve Koomar, former derivative trader at Goldman Sachs and editor of Vigilante Investor, breaks down the acquisition…  but explains how retail's downward spiral has created one of the largest disconnects in the market today.   This disconnect, Steve says, has opened the gates for private equity firms or companies like Amazon – companies desperately looking to improve earnings – to scoop up exceptional brick and mortars at rock-bottom valuations.   He also shares a list of companies that could be the next takeover target… and fantastic opportunities for value investors…   In addition, Steve explains why the iron and steel industry is poised for a sharp turnaround... and three "disruptive" tailwinds for U.S. producers going forward.   But don’t sign off once Steve leaves. For this week’s Educational Segment [52:10], I'll give you an important oil sector update… and discuss one of the greatest arts of investing: Learning how to adapt.   As always, thanks for listening and good investing!   Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[“Management teams only tell the best part of their story” -– Michael Alkin Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. This week, one of my favorite short sellers in the business, Michael Alkin, joins the show. While most short analysts will only study company reports (revenues, earnings, or recent guidance), Michael takes the extra step others ignore.... He talks with customers... former employees... suppliers... and distributors. Only then will he decide where the chips fall. And on today's show, Michael tells one of the best stories I've heard on Wall Street. It includes an incompetent company… a costume… and one ballsy analyst. Tune in to learn more about Michael's contrarian approach to short selling… along with two sectors he predicts are about to blow up. Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

And on today's show, Michael tells one of the best stories I've heard on Wall Street. It includes an incompetent company… a costume… and one ballsy analyst. Tune in to learn more about Michael's contrarian approach to short selling… along with two sectors he predicts are about to blow up. Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. Last week, the S&P dropped the furthest it has since May after Donald Trump's fiery comments about North Korea. Global markets sold off almost immediately, yet only to be met with something we should be all too familiar with… A quick recovery. Over today’s eight-year bull market, there’s been an interesting dynamic that’s played out over and over again, and it has helped keep this rally afloat through some questionable times... But if it’s not Trump that’s pushing the market higher these days… what else is there? It’s questions and times like these that call for a real expert: A guy I can ask anything, who can take a conversation in any direction. From dangerous “buy mode” algo’s, earnings season, and the weakening of the US dollar... to the parabolic climb of bitcoin, and how to protect yourself from today’s recent volatility… Today’s guest and I discuss all four corners of the market.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged!   I just returned home from the 2017 Sprott Natural Resource Symposium in Vancouver… my go-to conference each year.   It’s where the most successful junior mining investors and executives gather from around the globe… where I've learned about companies like McEwen Mining, Sandstorm Gold, and Northern Dynasty... and where I get to sit in exclusive closed-door sessions with company insiders.   On this week's show, I'm honored to re-introduce the Executive Chairman of, by far, the most promising company of this year’s Symposium.   His name is Ivan Bebek.   His company is about to embark on one of the largest drilling programs in the junior resource space today. And if they hit… investors could see a 50%-plus pop in shares almost immediately.   It’s the type of risk/reward setup that’s too favorable to ignore.   That’s the good news…   Some of what I witnessed in Vancouver was cringeworthy… the same pump and dump scams I’ve seen too many times.   It reminded me why the natural resource industry can be so dangerous for investors. So on this week's Educational Segment, I’ll remind you of the key things to watch out for.   Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

Each individual is a close friend. Every time you get together, personal experiences are shared, lessons are learned, and stories are told. You all have one thing in common: You’re super-rich. Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. Today I welcome first-time guest and Founder and Chairman of the exclusive Tiger 21 investment club -- Michael Sonnenfeldt. Tiger 21 is a peer-to-peer learning network for high net worth individuals. I'm talking about entrepreneurs, executives, and visionaries from around the world with over $10 million in investable assets. Every month, these guys get together to share insider information, talk investments, and create partnerships or joint ventures that can last lifetimes. And on this special episode of Wall Street Unplugged, you're right in the room with them... Michael exposes what’s actually being talked about behind these closed doors… giving us insight into what some of the wealthiest investors on the planet are forecasting for the remainder of 2017. The conversation ranges from venture capital projects to real estate to public and private equities. More specifically, we learn about Tiger 21’s holistic approach to assessing risks... the hidden bubble behind every hedge fund… and the average investor's biggest risk going forward (and it has nothing to do with geopolitics, Trump, or a market at all-time highs). As I always say – there’s nothing more powerful than real-time, trustworthy information. And here it is, first-hand, from the top 1% of today’s global investors…]]></description>

Chris is a weekly contributor for Business Insider, Forbes, and The Street.com. He's also the host of his own financial podcast, Cocktail Investing. Simply put, and like myself, the guy’s a stock market junkie. But his “thematic” approach is something totally different. He call’s it “the death of sector investing…” And it might even be ahead of it’s time. Theme by theme, Chris breaks down the market as a whole… discussing recently released economic data, what he calls the "Trump Slump," and how investors should prepare for the upcoming Q2 earnings season. Chris also unveils two “dividend dynamos”... and two small-cap companies listeners MUST add to their watchlist… Good Investing, Frank Curzio P.S. After Chris leaves us, keep listening for this week’s Educational Segment [], where I explain how to avoid “value traps" that even the best investors fall into -- when companies look cheap, but in reality, they’re far from it.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged!   This week, Jonathan Awde joins me on the show. Jonathan, CEO and President of Gold Standard Ventures (NYSE:GSV), gives us an inside look at what’s exactly taking place in today’s dispirited gold sector.   Whether its inflation, geopolitical risks, or weakness in the dollar... As of recent, investors are having a difficult time finding gold’s next growth catalyst…   Jonathan, nonetheless, sheds lights on a much clearer picture.   In part to recently released economic data, he explains why the sector may finally be reaching the tipping point we’ve all been patiently waiting for.   Jonathan then talks about Gold Standard Ventures.   Despite flatlining prices, the company is in the midst of its “largest drilling project” to date.   Tune in as Jonathan catches listeners up to speed… breaking down the company’s recent acquisitions, drilling results, and how the company is quietly positioning itself for gold’s inevitable bounce-back.   Good Investing,   Frank Curzio   PS - Don’t leave when Jonathan signs-off. On this week’s Educational Segment, I talk about a strategy I use to get my biggest, yet safest returns… a methodology, no matter how many times I mention it, no one ever uses.   Here we go again…]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. He's back… Managing Director at Point View Wealth Management and Wall Street Unplugged all-time favorite, John Petrides, joins the show once again. And apart from our quarterly routine, jumping from one sector to another, today we're turning all of our focus on one. Just last week, a surprisingly big acquisition took place in the retail sector; Private equity firm Sycamore bought out Staples for $10.25 per share… in a deal valued close to $7 billion. Shares of Staples, which have been on a steady decline for the past decade, finally found some life - after shares surged more than 8% in late session trading. All of which, has got John thinking... Helped along by today’s low interest rate environment, on top of a severely depressed, cheap, and hated retail sector… John’s prediction is that we’re still in the early innings of these takeover deals. On today’s show, we each give away our best guesses at which retailer is next. Including one big-box that just might be Jeff Bezos’s next lunch. You heard it here first. Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[  Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. It may look like you can't miss by going short now… Most stocks are at all-time highs… we’re seeing new records almost every week... and at this point, even perma-bulls are stuttering. The inevitable is just around the corner, right? For the past eight months short-sellers have had it increasingly rough. Just take a look at the charts. It’s obvious. Minor market pullbacks have been met with even bigger buying opportunities. And earnings along with valuations today continue to surge. Expectations… well, they’re still bullish. Simply put, if you want to short in today’s game, investors have to be more methodical than ever before. Which leads me to today’s guest - short-selling expert, Michael Alkin. Michael is a former hedge fund analyst, portfolio manager and is currently the Editor & Founder of The Stock Catalyst Report. As Michael points out, even in today’s market, some expectations are far from reality. With all the day-to-day noise we hear surrounding Wall Street, Michael breaks down some alarming, yet subtle changes particular companies are making that are going completely unnoticed… Leaving short-sellers, for those that are still alive, with a surprisingly exciting opportunity. The only hard part is -- where do you look? Tune in as Michael unveils his favorite short-selling methodology… showing listeners exactly where to find these opportunities and the all the risks that come with it. On the flip side, Michael brings up a sector he’s going “all-in” on. Frequent Wall Street Unplugged listeners have heard the same thesis over and over again from some of the smartest people in the industry. However, to end the episode, Michael brings up two catalysts listeners have yet to hear. “In my 20-plus years of my career, this is the best risk/reward ratio on the long-side I’ve ever seen.” Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

On the show, Frank introduces listeners to yet another ETF he plans on launching at the end of this month. The timing couldn't of been better... Especially when you consider, as we'll talk about, the recent rebalancing of the GDXJ - a very popular junior mining Exchange Traded Fund that has recently caused a seismic shock through out the mining sector. Just like Frank's first ETF (NYSE: JETS), which was introduced two years ago and covers the airliner industry, this fund is being launched in the middle of an out-of-favor down cycle... Leaving the public a chance to invest in a basket of stocks with very limited down-side risk. Tune in as Frank breaks down US Global's latest venture... and how his smart data, "moneyball" approach can be an industry game-changer. Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking. If you’re interested in buying some video game stocks but don’t understand the differences between the U.S-based big three; Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO)... Today’s show is right up your alley. In comparison to movies, TV studios, and other corners of the entertainment industry, no other sector has seen this much success in recent quarters. In fact, video game stocks have been in an all-out frenzy...  Revenues are growing… share prices are reaching new all-time highs almost every week… and the combined market-cap of these companies now reach over $80 billion. Over the last two years alone, shares of Take-Two have nearly tripled, Activision has more than doubled, and EA is up over 80%.  Unlike, let’s say, just five years ago… Video game companies no longer have to wait till Christmas time to make their profits. Those days are over. Today, digital revenues now come from an array of sources like in-game advertising, downloadable map-packs, full-game downloads, subscriptions… along with the consumer's ability to purchase virtual cars, clothes, and guns with real dollars - pushing company valuations even higher. Let’s not forget to mention their impact on the world of mobile gaming... Now although I wouldn’t be going all-in at these levels, on today’s show, I jump into the nitty-gritty. And give away my favorite bet out of the three. Switching gears, I turn my focus to a sector that is showing no signs of slowing down. It’s sort of like the video game industry with only more potential. Like four times the potential.  I’m calling out what some investors in this sector are failing to do:  Looking at the bottom-line numbers and fundamentals… NOT only the stock price. (Yes, some are expensive) Investing in future growth catalysts… NOT only in momentum (cough, cough, Nvidia).  The truth is, there are still several companies out there climbing at only 15x forward earnings… in a sector that’s still very much in its infancy. Special thanks to George, Sheryl, and Jerry for all the questions. Keep them coming at Frank@CurzioResearch.com Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

Let’s not forget to mention their impact on the world of mobile gaming... Now although I wouldn’t be going all-in at these levels, on today’s show, I jump into the nitty-gritty. And give away my favorite bet out of the three. Switching gears, I turn my focus to a sector that is showing no signs of slowing down. It’s sort of like the video game industry with only more potential. Like four times the potential.  I’m calling out what some investors in this sector are failing to do:  Looking at the bottom-line numbers and fundamentals… NOT only the stock price. (Yes, some are expensive) Investing in future growth catalysts… NOT only in momentum (cough, cough, Nvidia).  The truth is, there are still several companies out there climbing at only 15x forward earnings… in a sector that’s still very much in its infancy. Special thanks to George, Sheryl, and Jerry for all the questions. Keep them coming at Frank@CurzioResearch.com Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[Longtime friend, Andrew Horowitz, and I were talking on the phone the other day…   Apart from catching up as close friends, we dove into some interesting talks about today's economy…   I mean, how could we not?   Oil and financials are rolling over, wage growth & home-sales are weakening, auto sales are down, commercial real-estate… yikes.   And, on the other hand, you have only a select group of stocks (FANG) that’s really pushing this market… all while the “investor fear gauge” known as the VIX is sitting below 10.   Basically, we're seeing correlations we've never seen before... intertwined with market highs that have never been reached.   Andrew is calling today's market "terribly euphoric."   And although I love proving him wrong, with that statement, I couldn't agree more.   So on this week’s episode, as two guys sitting at a bar over some beers would do - we're taking this conversation in every direction.   No agenda..   No bullish or bearish anything…   Instead, we're taking a step back. And looking at the market as a whole - analyzing the recent “hard” economic data, earnings, politics, bitcoin, and even fishing.   Conversations like this is what my podcast is all about.   Just click here to listen…   As always, thanks for tuning in and good investing,   Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[    “There’s only about one-hundred thousand of them…” he said. At the time, I was standing in the middle of what’s known as the largest building in the world - Boeing’s airplane-assembly facility in Everett, Washington. I was extremely interested in these planes, to say the least... The demand for Boeing’s new and revolutionary-efficient 737 is off the charts. It’s the company’s fastest selling jetliner in its 100 plus years of existence. The most recent model sells for just north of $119.2 million. And I was standing directly under the wing of one. In my 20 plus year career of investing, visiting different sites and projects all around the world, nothing was more intriguing to me than this one. Dan Schull, the Sales Director at Boeing, and probably one of the most important figures in the $6 trillion aerospace and defense industry, was personally guiding me (along with a small group of investors) on a private tour of the world-class property. Now at this point in the story, most would assume I am about to dive into why Boeing might be a top-notch investment.  After-all, the aerospace industry is in a supreme bull-market as we speak…  But that’s not why I’m here. What caught my attention… and what today’s show is all about is that “100,000” number. It was music to my ears when Dan mentioned it. That’s the number of parts it takes to build each one of Boeing’s next-generation 737 MAX aircrafts.  You see, those 100,000 parts yield over 100 different publicly-traded companies.  Companies I personally like to call “Nuts & Bolts” stocks.  It’s something my Curzio Venture Opportunities subscribers are all too familiar with. In fact, in recent months I provided subscribers with two recommendations surrounding what I saw firsthand, on that single day. But this is still a strategy common investors constantly overlook.  And it’s simply where the better opportunities are. Opportunities that have a much higher ceiling than their contracting partners that EVERYONE already knows about - companies like Apple, Microsoft, or Boeing. The strategy I unfold today focuses on the companies that actually leech onto these household names. As the larger companies (like Boeing) gain popularity on the street, pushing the stock price higher, these behind-the-scenes “nuts & bolts” companies take part in the ride up as well.  And because of their small size, share prices can often explode in a matter of 24 months.  When industry leaders produce their widely known products, (Apple iPhones, Boeing 737 airplanes, Amazon’s Alexa) they don’t actually make all the parts that go into them. Instead, they outsource the majority of the pieces, often coming from smaller companies. But unlike these smaller companies, industry giants rarely ever see massive short-term gains, even in bull-markets… And rarely ever get bought out either. Because, well, they’re industry leaders. The “nuts & bolts” companies are where the real margins are. And to top it off, these opportunities fly completely under-the-radar in mainstream media - giving us the advantage. Good Investing,  Frank Curzio Special thanks to James, Evan, and Ryan.  Keep the questions coming at frank@curzioresearch with “Frankly Speaking” in the email subject line. Other topics talked about: Should we really be waiting for a market pullback?... Why it’s time to sell your FANG stocks… and one car-rental company that could pop 20% within 6 months from now.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged.   This week I’m again joined by the one and only market veteran – Richard Suttmeier.   Rich has been analyzing stocks for over 40 years, is a weekly contributor for Forbes and TheStreet.com, and is the founder and CEO of Global Market Consultants.   As my frequent listeners know, Rich is probably the biggest permabear I invite on the show.   Our opinions almost always contradict...   Yet for this reason, he is an asset for all my investment theses… Why?   Rich has a knack for uncovering data no else seems to mention. He calls it "the balance sheet of the U.S. economy," otherwise known as the FDIC Banking Profile.   And although he uses this overlooked data to contest nearly everything I put on the table...  It always helps to hear the otherside.   If you own a stock, or a have any interest in a certain sector... you don't want to talk to the hundreds of people that love it. Instead, you want to hear from that one guy who hates it.   And Rich is that guy.   On today's show he brings the heat - focusing on the downside risks of oil, semiconductors, utilities, housing markets, and his favorite, the financial industry.   If you have bets on any of these sectors, let Rich challenge your perspective. It won't hurt.   Then, for today's Educational Segment [43:13], I’m breaking down a stock that the whole world’s in love with right now.   It’s a global tech “darling” and is part of a select group of stocks that essentially drives the entire market, also known as FANG.   But trading at 23 times earnings, after coming off four straight quarters of positive earnings estimates, I make the case for why it’s time to cash in… and take profits any off the table. Recent momentum has carried on just too far.   Good Investing,   Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Happy Memorial Day Weekend! Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking. Today I’m packing my bags and heading to middle state, Nevada. A brand-new mining company is coming together… coming from a management team Wall Street Unplugged listeners are all too familiar with. There’s no IPO yet… Not even a symbol… And fortunately, before word spreads any further, I’ve been invited to check out this developing project. This weekend. Firsthand. It’s an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. And from the looks of it right now, this could potentially be one of the best mining companies I’ll ever recommend. Moving on, I then cover a company that is now on the street’s center stage - Best Buy (BBY). Last week, the electronic retailer posted better-than-expected earnings results from top to bottom.  This includes a reported 60 cents Earnings Per Share versus last year’s 44 cents per share. Digital sales grew more than 22%... And more important, comparable same-store sales rose 1.6% overall versus an expected decline. The stock jumped nearly 20% this week from the news… and is seemingly beginning to show signs of having the right formula to go up against Amazon. Who’s saying big box retailers are dead? Tune in to hear out my entry point strategy. Special Thanks to Micha, Ron, and Don for all the questions. Keep em’ coming at Frank@CurzioResearch.com  Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[“You see, this is where a lot of investors get confused...” As today’s first-time guest explains… “The goal in trading isn’t to be right” he says. The goal of investing lies far beyond that… Well, not really. It’s actually pretty simple. All us investors are here for one thing and one thing only - Money. And oddly enough, as most successful investors know, you don’t necessarily have to be right in order to make money.  In some instances, betting against your own will, in trades you don’t even believe in, can give you returns beyond belief. Literally. Which leads me to today’s market...  Currently we’re standing in a relentless, but confusing, bull market. Stocks are expensive and continue to push to record highs… Trump’s pro-growth initiatives are flatlining… and potential bubbles are beginning to steer investors south. Is there still money to be made here? Enter today’s guest, Jared Dillian. Jared is the editor of the Daily Dirtnap, and author of the 10th Man newsletter. Before Jared started writing in 2008, he worked for the Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers - first as an index arbitrage trader and then as head of the ETF trading desk. Jared's "macro" investment methodologies brings Wall Street Unplugged listeners a whole new perspective.  Rather than stressing too much on the technicals or fundamentals, Jared mainly focuses on two things: Sentiment & Psychology. In other words, Jared’s known as a behavioral economics expert. “I’m skeptical of everything I read and hear.” And quite frankly, there’s no reason we shouldn’t be either. The fact is, 90% of investors make poor and irrational investment decisions. Market sentiment often swings aggressively… and unfocused, under-the-radar opportunities are left on the table. It’s one of the perks of investing with a contrarian mentality. All thanks to the combination of irrational investment decisions and conventional economics, bear or bull market, these hidden opportunities appear constantly. And on today’s show, Jared shares a few of them...  Tune in as he gives listeners his ideas around Bitcoin, the next potential bubble, and his favorite sector going forward for the year 2017. More important, Jared explains to listeners one of the most underpriced investments to make right now. And the timing of this couldn’t be better. Then, for today’s Educational Segment, I’ll be breaking down a batch of stocks that go by the name of the “Dividend Aristocrats.” These are elite dividend paying S&P 500 companies who have managed to increase their annual dividend for the past 25 years consecutively. Some might sound familiar, while others, you’ve never heard of. The only problem is - nearly all of them have prices that have run up tremendously. And choosing one to invest in is a lot harder than it looks. Join me as I reveal my #1 buy and hold long-term stock from this exclusive list of companies. Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking. This week's breakdown is starting with Alibaba (BABA). Originally, the Chinese e-commerce company received loads of skepticism in regards to their deliverability and figures. Basically, analysts didn't believe the financials. But that was two years ago... Recently, the stock has been delivering some solid numbers that you can't ignore. The company is seeing its highest growth in revenues since their IPO... mobile use is stretching past 500 million monthly users... and not mention, Chinese e-commerce is skyrocketing. This company is no longer a momentum play. And to start off today's stream of Q&A's, I explain why. Switching gears, I then turn my focus to General Electric (GE). I completely understand the concerns for the short-term investors... The stock has sold off a bit... Deutsche Bank recently placed a sell rating on the stock... and cash concerns continue to push analysts away. But as I explain, there are still plenty of over-looked, long-term catalysts. Other topics talked about: BlackBird Energy's (BBI.V) recent drilling troubles, and just a little more politics. No personal hard feelings here. My concerns have very much to do with the financial markets. Special thanks to Larry, Howard, Faye, John, and Derek for all the questions.

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged.   Marin is back!   For those unfamiliar, Marin Katusa, the founder of Katusa Research, is probably the most connected guy in the resource industry.   As always, he comes on the show to give listeners his insight and full updates in the gold, uranium, and energy industries.   Coming from a guy who is usually bullish when it comes to junior miners… Today, Marin is taking a completely different stance.   You heard that right.   Marin, who focuses 100% of his time on the resource sector, is giving investors a fair warning.   “A tsunami of selling is coming to the junior mining sector.”   And oddly enough, it has nothing to do with the companies themselves.   The rising issue for junior miners lies behind a major rebalancing of a popular Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) known as the VanEck Junior Gold Miner (symbol GDXJ).   Marin is here to give you all the details of this developing story… and explain why this already weak sector will get even worse.   In a matter of weeks, Marin expects these small-cap stocks can plummet as far 25%-50%.   However, as Marin explains, this news will lead to a chain reaction that is “music to our ears…”   “You want to buy when others are forced to sell,” he says.   This will be one of those rare market opportunities where investors can buy some of the world’s most valuable junior gold companies for pennies on the dollar.   Marin and I then talk about the one and only Northern Dynasty (NAK). Marin’s been closely studying this stock for over two years now. In fact, he’s the one who initially introduced me to it when the stock was at only 40 cents.   Now that the long awaited EPA agreement with the company has finally been settled, to end the episode, Marin shares with us NAK’s biggest catalyst going forward.   Let’s not forget: We’re talking about the world’s largest undeveloped copper and gold mine here. It’s just the beginning.   Also, don’t sign off when Marin leaves…   99% of investors, even Marin, are bearish when it comes to the oil and gas industry. But not me. On this week’s Educational Segment, I explain why we should all be aggressively buying in the sector before OPEC comes out with another game-changing announcement.   Good Investing,   Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking. Whenever I'm up on a stock, there always comes a time and place to take my profits off the table... And unlike how we protect ourselves on the downside by the use of stop-loss orders... there is really no set formula when it comes to booking profits. The answer remains in your initial investment thesis. And to start off today's episode, I explain exactly what I mean. Moving on... I then discuss a stock that is now on my radar, only thanks to you - my readers who question-in. When I first looked at the stock, which is currently sitting at 7 cents, I laughed... But it turns out this company makes a very interesting play. It has all the factors I like: The company has key projects under great jurisdictions... they have great investors and parters... and more important, they have an excellent management team in place. In fact, the company's most recent addition to their board of directors has come from one of the most successful publicly traded agriculture companies in the world - Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (POT). Switching gears, I then break down the oil & gas industry as a whole. OPEC is expected to extend cuts, more production will be coming offline, and investor sentiment continues to remain negative. But that doesn't mean there isn't buying opportunities... And finally, although I might be stepping over my boundaries, to end today's episode, I talk a little bit of politics. Excuse me for my rant... but I just had to say it. Special thanks to Wade, Phil, Dominic, and Jesse. Keep the questions coming! Thanks for tuning it and good investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged!   Today I’m joined by both Amir Adnani - CEO of Uranium Energy Corp (UEC) & Chairman of GoldMining Inc. (GOLD.V). And also, Steve Koomar - former derivative trader at Goldman Sachs and editor of the Vigilante Investor newsletter.   That’s right, instead of having only one guest join me, today I’ll be picking the minds of two.   And starting with Amir, as he puts it, “It’s time for our quarterly update.”   In recent months, Gold Mining Inc. has quietly made a few significant acquisitions including one as recent as this morning.   Nothing surprising here.   Amir and his team continue to add to the thesis they’ve been focused on all along - buying assets at a fraction of their value. And on today’s show, Amir breaks down each of these new entry points.   He calls it “creating value with certainty.”   As the gold sector is in the midst of another unfavorable market downturn, this exactly what investors want to see.   Poised for a market rebound, GoldMining is adding ounces in the ground with consolidations that now stretch from Brazil and Columbia to Alaska and Northern Canada.   We then turn our focus to Uranium…   As many of you know, this is a sector that I continue to pound the table on.   The price of Uranium is finally coming off it’s 12-years lows… nuclear power plants are being built at a record pace… Japanese reactors are coming online again… and the new US administration is steering further away from renewables.   Fundamentally, every piece of the puzzle is coming in place for a market turnaround.   But from an individual standpoint, Amir’s Uranium Energy Corp. is facing a catalyst much more unique.   This is the same catalyst that pushed the stock up hundreds of percent last time it occurred. And there’s a “very good chance” it can happen again here within the next couple of weeks.   Be sure to tune in before Steve signs on as Amir goes over this potentially game-changing announcement.   Moving on, Steve Koomar and I then discuss arguably the most hated industry in the markets today - Oil & Gas.   Like myself, Steve thinks as the classic contrarian. And due to developing geopolitical pressures, Steve explains why the oil and gas market may see a huge boost in prices.   And finally, to wrap things up, Steve then uncovers his favorite foreign market to invest in.   It’s a market that has gone up 60% in the past 12 months alone.   And for first time in nearly 2 decades, the country’s political landscape is shifting towards pro-business initiatives.   As Steve explains, there’s a “nice-long runway” ahead for this country that’s finally beginning to develop its natural resources.   You see, everything covered on today’s show falls under one clear theme: How to master the resource market’s cyclicality.   If you plan to invest in any of the natural resources we cover today like gold, oil, and uranium…. this interview is a must listen.   Because like any cyclical market, betting on these recommendations early, at these depressed levels can yield life-changing results for those willing to wait.   Be sure to get your notepads ready…   Good Investing,   Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The questions are pouring in on IBM and Northern Dynasty (NAK)…   I’ve been bullish on each of these stocks in recent months. But after this week’s news, I have even more reason to add to my case.   On today’s show we start with IBM...   Warren Buffett just announced he sold off one-third of his position in the company, stating he “underestimated how much competition is in the space.” And later on said that he has revalued the stock “somewhat downward.”   It’s one of the very few investment choices Warren Buffett has made that hasn’t gone exactly as planned.   The stock price is down nearly 30% since Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invested close to $11 Billion back in 2011.   And today, as all eyes are still on Buffett, IBM shares have pulled back even further.   But as I explain on the show, I’m taking a completely different stance… and explain why there’s still plenty of room for IBM to grow at these levels.   Let’s not forget, this is not a momentum stock trading at insane valuations with no dividend…   We’re talking a durable company trading at just 12X earnings. And is paying a 4% dividend yield which is more than double of what the average company in the S&P 500 pays.   Moving on, I then discuss the recent news surrounding NAK and the infamous EPA.   A settlement is expected to take place in less than one week. And from the looks of it, each party seems to be on common grounds.   Tune in as I explain why the world’s largest undeveloped copper and gold mine should be everyone’s radar in the next couple of days.   Other topics talked about: Sandstorm Gold’s (SAND) recent merger… The current state of oil & gas… and why America needs deregulation before tax and healthcare reforms.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! Today I’m breaking all the rules… Just last week I talked about the benefits of compounding wealth… how long-term value investing is the safest, and smartest strategy for anyone betting in the markets. Even my new newsletter, Curzio Research Advisory, has stock recommendations based off favorable trends for the next 5, 10 years, and beyond… Today’s guest however is someone that takes a completely different angle… His name is Tim Sykes. Everyone has their own strengths. For example, Chris Mayer is a legend at picking international stocks. My other frequent guest, Marin Katusa, is a resource stock sniper. I personally have a knack for picking junior miners and small-cap biotech stocks. And then there’s Tim... Tim is a financial activist, educator, and is most famously known for his success at day trading penny stocks. He focuses on, no doubt, the most speculative and riskiest investments in the market today… yet has found massive success doing it. He’s the only penny stock expert I know. And on today’s show, he’s giving away all of his secrets. And shows listeners exactly how he takes advantage of the market’s hidden inefficiencies. Now before we get into the technicals, I’ll start with the easy stuff… Penny stocks are far from normal stocks. Some are not even listed on major exchanges… New investors often see these stocks with low prices and think they’re bargains. But what they don’t understand is that the chances of seeing positive returns are highly unlikely. You’re more likely to lose money. Here’s the truth: About 97% of penny stocks are awful companies or, flat-out, horrible investment choices. In my opinion, there are only 3 ways to actually make money on penny stocks. The first, is finding something I call a “revamp company.” Every once in a while a company will go bankrupt, maybe get bought out, and restructure their business models entirely. And at some point in that arch of a story, investors can get in at an huge discount. Again, this is an extremely rare occurrence… and takes a lot patience. Secondly, investors get lucky. They buy a stock for cents on a dollar, wait until they get lucky, and sell. It’s that simple. And then there’s Tim’s method - buying and selling off something called “pump and dumps.” And surprisingly, it’s consistent. You’re not diving into any profits, revenues, margins… None of that. Why? Because penny stock don’t have any. Instead, Tim advises listeners to just look at only two things: “Volume and price-action.” “...Who were today’s highest percent gainers and losers… and why?” Of course, as Tim explains on the show, there are a couple strict guidelines to follow. But more important, these “pump and dump” schemes happen more than you’d think. As an avid investors, Tim and I have seen it all… Promotions, people who get paid to recommend stocks, targeted short-sellers, etc. The list goes on. Some of the biggest scams I’ve ever seen derive from pump and dump initiatives. And it’s nice to finally bring someone on the show that knows how to benefit from them. Yet only from the outside looking in. Again, this strategy is not for everyone… But if you can take it one step at a time, play by these specific rules, and bet on the right information... you can turn thousands into millions in a matter of days. Whether you play the upside or the downside, here's the only real way investors can money in this highly speculative market.]]></description>

Even my new newsletter, Curzio Research Advisory, has stock recommendations based off favorable trends for the next 5, 10 years, and beyond… Today’s guest however is someone that takes a completely different angle… His name is Tim Sykes. Everyone has their own strengths. For example, Chris Mayer is a legend at picking international stocks. My other frequent guest, Marin Katusa, is a resource stock sniper. I personally have a knack for picking junior miners and small-cap biotech stocks. And then there’s Tim... Tim is a financial activist, educator, and is most famously known for his success at day trading penny stocks. He focuses on, no doubt, the most speculative and riskiest investments in the market today… yet has found massive success doing it. He’s the only penny stock expert I know. And on today’s show, he’s giving away all of his secrets. And shows listeners exactly how he takes advantage of the market’s hidden inefficiencies. Now before we get into the technicals, I’ll start with the easy stuff… Penny stocks are far from normal stocks. Some are not even listed on major exchanges… New investors often see these stocks with low prices and think they’re bargains. But what they don’t understand is that the chances of seeing positive returns are highly unlikely. You’re more likely to lose money. Here’s the truth: About 97% of penny stocks are awful companies or, flat-out, horrible investment choices. In my opinion, there are only 3 ways to actually make money on penny stocks. The first, is finding something I call a “revamp company.” Every once in a while a company will go bankrupt, maybe get bought out, and restructure their business models entirely. And at some point in that arch of a story, investors can get in at an huge discount. Again, this is an extremely rare occurrence… and takes a lot patience. Secondly, investors get lucky. They buy a stock for cents on a dollar, wait until they get lucky, and sell. It’s that simple. And then there’s Tim’s method - buying and selling off something called “pump and dumps.” And surprisingly, it’s consistent. You’re not diving into any profits, revenues, margins… None of that. Why? Because penny stock don’t have any. Instead, Tim advises listeners to just look at only two things: “Volume and price-action.” “...Who were today’s highest percent gainers and losers… and why?” Of course, as Tim explains on the show, there are a couple strict guidelines to follow. But more important, these “pump and dump” schemes happen more than you’d think. As an avid investors, Tim and I have seen it all… Promotions, people who get paid to recommend stocks, targeted short-sellers, etc. The list goes on. Some of the biggest scams I’ve ever seen derive from pump and dump initiatives. And it’s nice to finally bring someone on the show that knows how to benefit from them. Yet only from the outside looking in. Again, this strategy is not for everyone… But if you can take it one step at a time, play by these specific rules, and bet on the right information... you can turn thousands into millions in a matter of days. Whether you play the upside or the downside, here's the only real way investors can money in this highly speculative market.]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! Today I begin the show by giving away a list of large-cap, well-managed, and durable companies. I'm talking about proven companies that have been around for decades… and the ones that have a history of increasing their dividend annually. More important, some of the stocks I uncover today are at value prices. Although some might be underperforming, buying them at current levels can prove to be monumental in the long-run. Again, these are stocks that investors can hold onto forever. Switching gears, I answer a question on stop-loss orders. This particular question asks what the difference is between "Trailing stop-loss percentages" and "Trailing stop-limit percentages?" My answer: It doesn't matter! Today, I explain the importance of "handing you hand." And my favorite third-party tool that doesn't show the market your every move. Then, to end the episode, I'm taking another stock and looking under the hood. It’s a stock that might seem favorable from a glance... but today I point out all the negatives, giving as much analysis as I can. It's why I'm here. Special thanks to Larry, Jose, Chris, Mark, and Jack for all the great questions. Keep ‘em coming at frank@curzioresearch.com]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. This week I welcome back Garth Braun, Chairman & CEO of BlackBird Energy (BBI.V). Last time Garth was on the show he introduced listeners to one of the finest oil patches in North America - Canada’s Montney Formation. This liquid-rich shale area is now home to some of largest players in the industry - companies like Encana, Apache, Sinopec, and Shell. It’s Canada’s next big energy bet. And Blackbird Energy, the small-cap exploration and development company, was one of the first to discover it. So to start off the episode, Garth catches listeners up to date. He begins by breaking down Blackbird’s recent major capital raise… and how the company has added even more land into the Montney. Moving on, we then talk about the sector as a whole. As the “oil supply glut” continues to haunt investors across the industry, not to mention the increase of drilling costs overtime… companies like BlackBird Energy have been forced to innovate and adapt to current market conditions. And this is what makes Garth’s company so unique. Blackbird has implemented and acquired a 10% stake in Stage Completions - a leading edge optimization technology that reduces drill times, increases tonnage, and cuts costs practically in half. Meaning, this is a company that can remain profitable with prices as low as $30/barrel. And in my 20+ years of research,  I’ve only seen a few cases where a company has that ability. If you’re invested in some of these huge producers that can only make profits on $50, $60 oil prices, it’s time to take another look. Blackbird Energy is trading at roughly the same levels as it was last time Garth was on the show. And although that was only 3 months ago, so much within the company has changed... For one, they’ve added more onto the Montney, they have increased reserves by more than 1,000%, and they have just placed over $80M into the bank. More importantly, Garth has managed to do all of this with zero debt, yet the stock is still priced under $1. To end the episode, Garth uncovers what investors can expect in the next 6 to 12 months… along with the company’s ambitious long-term growth plans. Although this stock might currently pose as too aggressive for some investors, on today’s episode, you won’t leave empty handed. Be sure to tune in as there is a ton of valuable information and insight on today's oil and liquids industry. Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! We're officially in a stock picker's market. The gold and junior mining sectors are not what they were two years ago. You used to be able to just take a dart, throw it, and be up 200% - 300%... But market dynamics have shifted. These are sectors that have recovered significantly since record-level lows. And now that the market has gone up, extra homework on the individual companies is a must. To begin today's show, I explain exactly what investors need to look for in these risky markets... and how to tell if their flagship mining projects are worth betting on. Switching gears... I then talk about the difference between American and Canadian stock exchanges... and why I always push listeners away from the OTC. Many of my stock recommendations fall under Canadian listed exchanges. And as I explain on the show... the more volume, the safer the exchange. Then, to end the episode, I share with listeners one of the biggest market disconnects today. This is a popular stock that has recently come down 8, 9 points and is currently sitting at a bargain price. Don't bet against Warren Buffett here. This particular company is spending a lot of money in all the right growth markets. Your'e getting paid to wait. Other topics talked about: An updated outlook of a stock I recommended 6 years ago - Steel Dynamics (STLD)...A break down on how private-placement offerings work... And an update on Amir Adnani's GoldMining (GOLD) Special thanks to Luke, Paul, Jared, Daniel, and Michael for all the great questions. Keep em coming!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. My guest this week is Chris Mayer, 20-year plus market veteran and editor of the Bonner Private Portfolio & Focus newsletter. Chris is constantly traveling the world to find unique investment opportunities. He’s like the Anthony Bourdain of finance. Every time Chris is on the podcast, he provides listeners with ideas that are completely off-the-radar. These are stocks most investors have never heard of... in markets most investors steer away from. Join me as he breaks down his hidden stock ideas, the banking sector, and his favorite emerging market to invest in right now - India. Since the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, the country has experienced a significant economic shift. Modi has set about cutting taxes, reducing regulation, addressing banking issues… all while controlling inflation. Chris is calling him “Reagan 2.0.” And the way Chris tells it, plenty of investment opportunities are slowly opening up. Chris then shares his personal experiences with billionaire and Agora founder Bill Bonner. In the mix of it all, Chris reveals his proprietary C.O.D.E system. This is an investment strategy he uses to outperform the S&P 500 year after year. As Chris explains, “there are lots of different ways for investors to get up the mountain…” But there’s only one key characteristic behind every ‘100 bagger.’ Plus, for this week's Educational Segment, I talk about something we are conditioned to avoid at ALL cost… Yet it’s something that is widely misunderstood. It's considered a "red flag" in every financial textbook and by analysts everywhere... But in reality, these are opportunities that can lead to returns beyond belief. As always, thanks for listening and good investing!]]></description>

This is an investment strategy I will use and strongly recommend for every stock pick in the portfolio. But as you might notice, my recommended stop-loss percentages often vary. Depending on the size of the stock and other technicals, the formula switches.  And this is extremely important for protection purposes. Today I explain why. Moving on... I then talk about a stock that I've been getting tons of emails on - Northern Dynasty (NAK). Just last week the state of Alaska came out with game-changing news surrounding NAK's land-permit. The stock rose 34.1% in one trading day. This is a huge slap in the face for the infamous short-seller Kerrisdale Capital. And I'll explain why. But we cannot forget... Northern Dynasty still has their biggest hurdle ahead. Join me this week as I break-down the recent news, what it means for the company, and how I think investors should react. Other topics talked about: Advice for any entrepreneurs, a perfect example of compounding your investments, and how to get your feet on the ground in the world of finance. Also, once again... And I'll never stop saying it... Thank you to all of my listeners for joining me on my newest venture - Curzio Research Advisory.  It's been a successful launch. And I'm already looking towards next months pick! Special thanks to Brett, Jose, Douglas, and John for all the great questions.  Keep them coming!

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! After a crazy week and the successful launch of my brand-new newsletter, Curzio Research Advisory… it’s time to get back to business. On this week’s show I’m jumping right back into my favorite sector, junior mining. Today I welcome back a guest that has made listeners a lot of money over the years… He is the co-founder & CEO of Gold Standard Ventures (NYSE: GSV), Jonathan Awde. The first time Jonathan was on the show, his exploration company, Gold Standard Ventures, was under 40 cents. Today, the company is over $2.00 per share. To start off the interview, Jonathan catches listeners up to date… breaking down their recent game-changing acquisitions. Including a 21,000 acre acquisition which increases their holdings at the south end of Nevada’s Carlin Trend by 66%.  Gold Standard Ventures now holds the second largest contiguous land package on Nevada’s Carlin Trend. It’s known as one of the most “prolific” gold producing areas in the world. But this isn’t the best part. For such a small exploration company, Gold Standard Ventures has been building an extremely strong treasury. As Jonathan will explain in the interview, several significant investors have bought stake in the company since we’ve last talked. One corporate investor in particular is Goldcorp. They are the 3rd largest gold producer in the world. And they recently increased their stake in the company over 10%. This is a huge factor going forward.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! After a crazy week and the successful launch of my brand-new newsletter, Curzio Research Advisory… it’s time to get back to business. On this week’s show I’m jumping right back into my favorite sector, junior mining. Today I welcome back a guest that has made listeners a lot of money over the years… He is the co-founder & CEO of Gold Standard Ventures (NYSE: GSV), Jonathan Awde. The first time Jonathan was on the show, his exploration company, Gold Standard Ventures, was under 40 cents. Today, the company is over $2.00 per share. To start off the interview, Jonathan catches listeners up to date… breaking down their recent game-changing acquisitions. Including a 21,000 acre acquisition which increases their holdings at the south end of Nevada’s Carlin Trend by 66%.  Gold Standard Ventures now holds the second largest contiguous land package on Nevada’s Carlin Trend. It’s known as one of the most “prolific” gold producing areas in the world. But this isn’t the best part. For such a small exploration company, Gold Standard Ventures has been building an extremely strong treasury. As Jonathan will explain in the interview, several significant investors have bought stake in the company since we’ve last talked. One corporate investor in particular is Goldcorp. They are the 3rd largest gold producer in the world. And they recently increased their stake in the company over 10%. This is a huge factor going forward. To add to the story… Jonathan gives listeners his 2017 outlook. As GSV plans to take on their biggest, most ambitious drilling program in the history of the company, Jonathan claims this is going to be their “biggest year” to date. So investors: If you felt you missed the boat last occasion… It’s time to take another look. At current levels, the stock looks attractive. Plus, the share price is coming off a 27% pullback from it’s highs. The company seems to be on the cusp of a rebound considering all the catalysts Jonathan unfolds in front of us today.

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! This week’s show is a special one… It’s the moment we’ve all been waiting for. My brand-new flagship newsletter, Curzio Research Advisory, is finally live. That’s right, it’s official. And before my guest signs on, I’ve prepared a special segment to tell you all about it. These are specific instructions, tips, and details on how listeners can make the best out of this limited-time opportunity. I’m then joined by Managing Director & Portfolio Manager at Point View Wealth Management - John Petrides. Today, John and I break down a number of topics - politics, emerging markets, economics, you name it… John knows it all. But to start off the interview, John brings up something that’s rarely addressed… It’s a period of time he calls the “Beartrap.” And we’re in the middle of it. It’s the time in between earnings seasons and, as John explains, when investors must be alert. This is when there’s a ton of headline risks... and when individual investors overly focus on short-term economic data. As John puts it, "we don’t want to make long-term decisions based on short-term risks.” Switching gears, John shares with listeners his favorite play in the energy sector. Just last week, this company announced a “home-run” deal. And as it continues to free up cash, lower debt, and buy back shares… this under-the-radar stock is poised for something huge. As always, before John signs off, he highlights his favorite sector going forward… The ultimate hedge against Trump.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! First and foremost… I want to thank everybody for their patience. My flagship newsletter, Curzio Research Advisory is just a few days away from launch. And today, without saying too much, I wanted to cover some last minute details. This will include some hints on what to expect, prices, my lifetime offer, and the special reports attached. And please, if you have any questions or concerns about receiving the offer… Email me directly at Frank@CurzioResearch.com. I want to make sure all of my followers have immediate access.  My next question comes from Chadwick. He brings up a mining stock located in a region I rarely cover - South Africa. As far as mining stocks go, is South Africa’s jurisdiction worth exploring? I then break down one of the most important factors to look for before any investment. This is something I check before I dive into any numbers or technicals. It's insider trading. Insider information is extremely valuable to us (individual investors). Insider trading shows insider confidence. Let's face it, the mangers and front office executive will always know something that we don't. Insider's buy for only one reason... And timing your investments with theirs can result in huge gains. Tune in to discover how to find them online. After all, it's free. Special thanks to George, Chadwick, Robert, Peter, and Brian. Keep the questions coming! Other topics talked about: The buying hated stocks methodology, and my thought process behind fertilizer/ farming investing.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! This week I’m joined by longtime friend, Andrew Horowitz. Andrew is the host of the financial podcast – The Disciplined Investor. He is also the CEO and Founder of Horowitz & Company. To start off the interview, Andrew and I talk about the #1 catalyst in the markets right now… We’re talking politics. As Andrew says, “everything the governments talk about, the markets hang their hats on.” And he couldn’t be more spot on. The stock market just had it’s worst week since the election after Donald Trump failed to rally support for his healthcare plan. And with markets already trading at a premium, investor sentiment is beginning to pull back. As we all know, the markets have reached new heights solely on anticipation of Trump’s pro-growth policies. But will they actually be carried out? Tune in as Andrew explains today’s overarching issue… And why paying close attention to the guys upstairs (the government) is now more important than ever before. Then, if there’s one thing that Andrew nails every time he’s on the podcast… It’s his short picks. To end the interview Andrew presents listeners with two more. This is a thesis investors don’t want to miss.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged!  On today’s show I bring back the rockstar of CEO’s – Keith Neumeyer. Keith is a pioneer in the resource industry. He has successfully built three publicly traded mining companies And today, he catches us up to date on two of them - First Mining Finance (FF.V), and First Majestic Silver (AG). I first invited Keith on the show directly after the launch of his first gold venture, First Mining Finance. At the time, the stock was at just at $.30. Today, the stock price rests right around $1. Keith has a knack for buying assets at the right time. In other words, he’s an expert at timing the market. As you’ll hear on the show, “what you pay for assets is how you create value” is his motto. When he launched First Mining Finance, gold prices were sitting at record-level lows. And when commodity prices finally rebounded last year, his company took off – reaching gains well over 300%. Today Keith gives us his outlook for the company going forward, along with the yellow-metal itself. Moving on, we turn our focus to Keith’s other company, First Majestic Silver (AG). First Majestic is the largest Silver producer in the world. And looking at the numbers, The company has everything in place.  Then for today’s Educational Segment, we take a closer look at one of my favorite market strategies – Buying hated stocks.  One-by-one, I break down a list of Wall Street’s most hated companys. These are the stocks that everyone avoids; and stocks that have “sell” ratings across the board. This includes names like Twitter, Valeant, Sears, Macy’s, Gamestop, and Target. By any means, what I am about to introduce to you is not an easy strategy… But when you follow these steps, it can work like a charm.  This is the stuff that has led me to my greatest gains in my career. And it’s the only contrarian formula you need to know.]]></description>

He’s looking for some help. And I promised him I would reach out to you - my listeners.   If you didn’t know, I worked under Jim for 5 years at TheStreet.com as an Senior Analys... And I have never had a better learning experience outside of that 5 year span.   It was a job of a lifetime. And I wouldn’t be here today without it. If interested in the opportunity, be sure to tune in for the specific instructions. I’ll see what I can do.   Moving on, and after some March Madness talk (sorry, I just had to mention my Jayhawks), we get back on track [14:40]. This is when I take a closer look at the gold stock, Timmins Gold Corp (TGD).   Tune in as I take listeners, start to finish, throughout my entire analysis process. These are my 6 never-skip qualifications before I make any mining investment.   This is the stuff that has saved me a fortune.   Special thanks to Zach, Darren, & Reymond.   Keep them coming!

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! On today’s show, I introduce listeners to Panna Sharma. Panna is the CEO and President of a small-cap, clinical and diagnostics company - Cancer Genetics (CGIX). Panna brings together everything you need to know about the company. It’s core focus? Precision medicine. And the drug industry is betting big on it… To start off the interview, Panna and I talk about how treatments and innovations in the industry are rapidly changing… In the past, companies were betting on single drugs and routine treatments to cure all. But considering the complex, biological diversity of something like cancer, there has never been and never will be “one answer.” Panna explains how the industry and his company in particular are making huge strides in the right direction. Recently, we’ve seen a transfer from trial-and-error medicines to evidence-based medicine. And instead of dividing patients into groups based on thousands of outcomes, today you can now treat patients baseds on the details of their own unique genes. The trend is the death of “one size fits all.” And companies like Cancer Genetics are sitting at the center of it. The business model, as Panna says, comes from a “multi-tiered” approach. The company focuses on drug design, clinical trials, and diagnosis development. It’s a strategy leveraged from genomic data, innovation, and collaboration. And it benefits both side’s of the equation - the world of biotech/pharma development, as well as the patients. Now for those that are familiar with my podcast, you know that I’m picky... And you probably have heard about my show’s golden rule -- To never bring on a CEO of a company I don’t personally believe in. In other words, don’t take this as a sales pitch. This company, no doubt, has long-term growth potential. And Panna has all the right answers to back it up… After looking at what’s actually on paper, it was difficult to turn away. For one, there’s high insider ownership. But more important, Cancer Genetics is working with 8 out of the top 10 biotech companies. A small company with strong partnerships with some of the biggest names in the industry is huge. This commercial traction alone is their strongest catalyst going forward. The current share price is sitting just above $2.00. And valuations are at a steep discount compared to other traditional genomic diagnosis companies. But before taking any action, note that earnings are only one week away. And considering the current shape of the industry, be sure to do some homework. Again, this is a long-term play… And resources like this interview are a great place to start. Not only is this a company that should be on everyone’s radar, this is one of those “feel good” stories. And I’m more than happy to introduce listeners to the opportunity. Just click here to listen…]]></description>

And to start off today's episode, I need to clear up some confusion. Listeners will hear all about my special offer, how to sign up, and a general description of what the newsletters entails. And as you'll hear, there's more to it than just stock picks... Moving on, today's main segment covers one of the most hated stocks on Wall Street - Target (TGT). All the analyst are negative... the price is sitting at multi-year lows... and the retail sector is spiraling downwards. I always advise my listeners to "never catch a falling knife" but for Target, this isn't the case anymore. Tune in as I explain why the risk/reward looks favorable. There are 3 major catalysts that I believe will finally drive this depressed stock higher. Thanks for listening and good investing! Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hello and welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! On this week's show I'm joined by market veteran - Richard Suttmeier. Rich has been analyzing stocks for over 40 years and is a weekly contributor for Forbes and TheStreet.com. He is the founder and CEO of Global Market Consultants. There's one thing about Richard that sets himself apart from any other guest I have on the show… He is the ultimate bear. But I don't blame him either… Rich is one of the few analysts I know that dives into data he calls “the balance sheet of the US economy.” Otherwise known as the FDIC Banking Profile. And on today’s episode, he takes us under the hood of the fourth quarter results - suggesting that some stocks have rallied too far, too fast. Rich brings the "overbought" argument back to the table. And highlights the several risks stocks are still exposed to… despite deregulation and other pro-business administrative efforts. He explains why investors need to play it safe and book their profits now, before it’s too late. As Richard puts it, a market correction is going to occur a lot sooner than expected. Now I can’t agree with everything… But as investors, it’s always important to look at a different perspective. And although Richard presents us with ideas that might sound extreme, let’s face it, you can never be “too safe.”]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! On today’s show I bring back Jordan Trimble - President and CEO of Skyharbour Resources (SYH.V). Skyharbour stands today as one of the most overlooked Uranium explorers. It's located in the heart of what's now known as the #1 mining jurisdiction is the world - Canada's Saskatchewan. Since Jordan was last on the show in November, we've seen a massive shift in the sector. Today, Jordan catches listeners up to date. Aside from Uranium prices finally coming off their lows... Skyharbour Resources alone has jumped nearly 150% in just 3 months. From .28 to .69, the stock still rests under $1 but as Jordan explains, this won’t be the case much longer… Skyharbour just released news on their most recent drilling program. And the results are game-changing. But as investors, lets not forget - junior miners don’t generate any revenue… cash concerns are critical, and at times, over-drilling can be detrimental... even in favorable economic conditions. As the company plans to aggressively drill in the near future, I ask Jordan the questions all investors need to know. Then, stepping back from the technicals, we take a closer look at the Uranium market as a whole. We already know demand is ramping up… but what about the other catalyst? As Jordan explains, there are multiple underestimated market components. These are factors that will only continue to drive Uranium prices higher. The fundamentals are all lining up. As for Skyharbour, if you took my recommendation a few months ago... keep enjoying the ride. As I expect Uranium prices to double in the next 6 to 12 months... well positioned companies like Jordan's should reap all the benefits. Also, don’t miss this week’s Educational Segment [45:36]. As the market continues to reach new all-time highs, fears are rising. Is the market too expensive? Are we overvalued? Absolutely not. Ignore it. Too many metrics are telling the wrong story.]]></description>

I’ve got a headache. And although there’s a lot to cover… today I take a moment to step away from the market-talk. No “shots fired” or anything, but there’s just a few things I need to clear up. And every once in awhile it’s a bit more fun hosting a show - without any filter. I use this occasion to talk about the last newsletter I worked for… one of the biggest insurance scams in the world… and my apparent faulty claims on Boeing’s automation front. As for the markets… Last week, I touched base on one of the largest bubbles on planet - Chinese real-estate. Time to short? ...Not so fast. On today’s show, I dig a little deeper. And by looking at the big picture, this is a situation that almost makes too much sense. Tune in as I explain why investors need to pump their brakes on this particular trade… Then, for today’s main segment, I talk about about the one and only - Tesla (TSLA). And why anything you read on this stock, you must take with a grain of salt. This is not a buy, or sell. In fact, I’m indifferent… But at least I tell the truth. Special thanks to Matt, Jake, Michael, Brian, and Joseph. Keep the questions coming!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! To begin the show, and before my guest signs on... I share one of the most underutilized tools in the world of financial research and analysis. They’re called 13F's. Every quarter, all hedge funds and institutional investment managers with over $100 million in qualifying assets are required to report something called a SEC 13F filing. Simply put, these 13F reports disclose what the largest investors in the world are buying and dumping… allowing regular people like you and me to see exactly where the "smart money" is moving. This is the easiest way investors can trade with famous traders like George Soros, Warren Buffett, or John Paulson. And they are publicly available every quarter… in full detail. Breaking down these reports can lead to the market's most interesting trends. And, with nothing to hide, this is where I find a lot of my new investment ideas. Today I share a few examples… Then for this week’s interview, I’m joined by John Petrides – Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Point View Wealth Management. John is a Wall Street Unplugged regular. From retail and telecom… to infrastructure, healthcare, and financial sectors... Every time John joins the show, he covers it all. And today he starts with earnings season... Thus far, just over 85% of the S&P 500 companies have reported earnings. And about 66% have exceeded analyst expectations. Today, however, we take a closer look at the more important metrics… Earnings growth has reached a 3-year high. And with forward expectations getting dangerously high, John raises all the right questions. We also talk about today's most hated industry… Out of all sectors this earnings season, none performed as poor as retail. Stores like JC Penney, Macy's, and Target have all been crushed this past holiday season. And although shopping trends continue to point online, John and I both agree that the end is nowhere near for department stores. Tune in to hear who we think will survive… To end the interview, John prepares investors for upcoming rate hikes. The fed fund rates are currently sitting at 1.25%. But due to “hawkish” changes coming soon, John expects rates to reach as high as 3% in only 2 years from now. More importantly, John shares with listeners his two favorite sectors going forward in today’s deregulatory environment. And also shares with us 4 international stocks that he considers “buys” today. Then, for my Educational Segment, I cover the fastest growing industry in the world. It has ties with every sector on the planet. However, because it’s still early, this highly talked about sector is a minefield. Join me as I break down the numbers… and show listeners exactly how they can stay one-step ahead of this enormous yet dicey industry.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! To begin the show, and before my guest signs on... I share one of the most underutilized tools in the world of financial research and analysis. They’re called 13F's. Every quarter, all hedge funds and institutional investment managers with over $100 million in qualifying assets are required to report something called a SEC 13F filing. Simply put, these 13F reports disclose what the largest investors in the world are buying and dumping… allowing regular people like you and me to see exactly where the "smart money" is moving. This is the easiest way investors can trade with famous traders like George Soros, Warren Buffett, or John Paulson. And they are publicly available every quarter… in full detail. Breaking down these reports can lead to the market's most interesting trends. And, with nothing to hide, this is where I find a lot of my new investment ideas. Today I share a few examples… Then for this week’s interview, I’m joined by John Petrides – Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Point View Wealth Management. John is a Wall Street Unplugged regular. From retail and telecom… to infrastructure, healthcare, and financial sectors... Every time John joins the show, he covers it all. And today he starts with earnings season... Thus far, just over 85% of the S&P 500 companies have reported earnings. And about 66% have exceeded analyst expectations. Today, however, we take a closer look at the more important metrics… Earnings growth has reached a 3-year high. And with forward expectations getting dangerously high, John raises all the right questions. We also talk about today's most hated industry… Out of all sectors this earnings season, none performed as poor as retail. Stores like JC Penney, Macy's, and Target have all been crushed this past holiday season. And although shopping trends continue to point online, John and I both agree that the end is nowhere near for department stores. Tune in to hear who we think will survive… To end the interview, John prepares investors for upcoming rate hikes. The fed fund rates are currently sitting at 1.25%. But due to “hawkish” changes coming soon, John expects rates to reach as high as 3% in only 2 years from now.

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! Keep the questions coming! Last week, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), otherwise known as the inflation rate, posted its largest gain in nearly four years - crushing expectations. And as Fed Chairman, Janet Yellen, has already promised, an interest rate hike is just around the corner. Investors everywhere are ramping up for this massive macroeconomic change. But what does this mean for gold? With mild inflationary trends and expected growth in the dollar… almost everyone is expecting the price of the yellow metal to drop. But I can’t say I agree… Then, taking my focus overseas, I talk about China’s massive real estate bubble. And highlight the best ways for investors to position themselves around the crisis. Get your pens ready as I give listeners a list of ETF’s to pay close attention to. Today’s show also covers one of the biggest topics addressed in this past election (republican or democrat) - American Infrastructure. As you’ll hear, the infrastructure trend is for real. And as far as President Trump’s lengthy promised to-do-list, I expect infrastructure changes to lead the way. Good new for investors - there are a ton of stocks still in the sector that are relatively cheap in comparison to the S&P500. Tune in as I explain why it’s time to start placing your bets… And finally, to end the episode, I bring a few stocks under the microscope. This includes some of the top companies in the US that paying the highest tax rates. The stocks are CVS Pharmacy, KMI, and General Electric. As always, thanks for tuning in and good investing, Frank Curzio PS - For those not familiar... I host my Frankly Speaking podcast every Friday. And unlike my Wall Street Unplugged podcast (I host every Wednesday), I use this show to answer my favorite subscriber questions I receive on my email. The goal is to help educate, advise, and guide listeners through all the noise surrounding the financial industry.

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! Today's guest is Frank Holmes, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of U.S. Global Investors. If there’s anyone that knows the global economy, it's Frank. To begin the episode, Frank talks about the reality of deregulation. As we all know, the Trump administration has promised massive tax reforms. But Frank argues that these reforms are going to take much longer than what has been initially anticipated. As Frank says, it’s time investors realize Trumps pro-business reforms will “take twice as long… cost twice as much… and will make everyone half as happy.” In addition, Frank explains his bullish stance on the mining, materials, and energy sectors. According to Frank, the recent cutbacks in supply for several commodities will soon lead to large increases in price. Changing topics, Frank then gives his outlook for the airline industry. Two years ago Frank’s company, US Global Investors, launched what’s now known as the #1 airlines ETF in the world (JETS). And his timing couldn’t of been better… Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, as of last week, is now investing $8M into the airliner industry. This is the same industry he called a “death trap for investors” just 5 years ago. As Frank explains, a lot has changed since then.  Following decades of mergers, bankruptcies, and other disruptions, this sector is finally finding some stability. And current valuations are low – trading at 12 times earnings. Tune in as Frank makes his case for the finest pure-play airliner investment in this rejuvenated sector. Then, to close up the interview, Frank discusses “smart data.” And his methodologies behind emerging market investments in countries like China, India, and Argentina. These are places where so many investors have been burnt – yet where Frank has found so much success. Although there is still money to make in America, Frank shows us little-known ways to diversify our portfolios overseas. Also, I'll be covering this week's interesting short report on Northern Dynasty (NAK). I've been getting tons of questions. And I hope this segment clears up all the confusion. This is one of the most corrupt occurrences in the financial industry... and it's completely legal! Before Frank Holmes signs on - I'll be highlighting the several blatant lies made in this report.   ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking!   Today's first question covers a stock I recommended over a year ago - Universal Corp (UVV).    This is a type of stock that is the complete opposite of any mining company I've ever mentioned. It's what I like to call an "elite dividend payer."   Most "elite dividend payers" are companies you'll never hear about. These are companies that have plenty of cash flow... they're not exiciting... and they don't plan on raising cash anytime soon.   Wall Street loves to rave on and on about a stocks capital gains but never the other crucial part of the formula - the dividend yield.   Over time, as these companies continue to raise their dividend, investors can make a fortune.   Then, there are some stocks you should never ever short or bet against. And believe it or not.. Tesla (TSLA) is one of them.    The company has a lot of work to do to live up to their valuations... and although the fundamentals scream its a sure short... Investors need to be very careful here. Tune in as I explain why. I'll be giving away the most important rule behind shorting stocks.   Also, I answer a question that couldn't be better as far as timing. It covers earnings season. There’s a lot of "funny money" business going on around this time of year. And analyzing stocks off these company earnings can get very confusing.   So, to end the episode, I clear some things up. I cover the difference between manipulated earnings and adjusted earnings. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hello and welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! Today I'm joined by longtime friend - Marin Katusa, CEO & founder of Katusa Research. For any new listeners out there, I often bring Marin on the show as he is, hands-down, the most connected person in the mining industry. To start off the interview, Marin discusses the current states of gold, uranium and other resource sectors. As every investor should know, the dollar almost always moves inversely with the price of gold. For this reason, gold investments are used as a "safe haven" for investors around the globe. When markets become volatile and fears arise, gold is usually your best hedge. In the event of market downturns, gold prices surge... limiting your losses. Again... the dollar/gold inverse relationship has been the common rule of thumb for as long as I can remember... Marin claims, however, that 2017 will be a break for this historical pattern.  And gives us a closer look as to why... Switching gears, we then talk about the geopolitical environment of one of the biggest trends today - Uranium. Through this analysis, Marin explains a huge angle of the Russia/ Trump story that nobody else is talking about... As a result, he shares with us one of the biggest secrets behind investing in Uranium this year. And tells listeners exactly where to avoid all Uranium investments. Then, the big announcement... Marin introduces listeners to another private placement opportunity. Listen up as this is your chance to invest with some of the greatest investors in the world. Marin will break down all the details. And give listeners everything they need to know about his next long-term commitment.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! Keep the questions coming!   The first topic of the day covers the inevitable... A recession. The business economy is one big cycle. Historically speaking, the markets expand, contract, and recover... over and over again. Where do we stand today? Well, theres been a lot of positives to takeaway from the markets recently... Let's take a closer look... Earnings are growing by 8% thus far for nearly 70% of S&P 500 companies... Wages are growing at the highest rate since 2009... And now, due to the Trump administration -  we're looking at new regulations and a massive tax reform in the near future. Trump, so far, has sent shockwaves throughout the market but the dollar continues to strengthen. As I explain in the show, the possibility of a near economic down cycle is slim - and way further out than I initially expected. But let's get back to the point... a recession is inevitable. As investors, we want to stay aware of where the markets are heading. And although you don't need to worry about another crisis anytime soon, you always want to be prepared. So tune in as I tell listeners which stocks you need to own - during a recession, and while the market is falling. Then, after a slew of earnings releases this week, there's a few companies I wanted to go over... The first company I break down is Facebook (FB) - what I now like to call the "the greatest company in the world." The social media giant just reported outstanding quarterly earnings by completely blowing estimates out of the water. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is like the Bill Gates of the 90's. Throughout my 20 years of financial research, I've never seen a company grow and dominate as quickly as Facebook has. Although we may see a slight pull back in the stock price in the coming weeks... I explain why the sky is the limit for this company. Chipotle (CMG), the other company I talk about on today's show, experienced just the opposite as fas earnings go... The company reported a 76% decrease in profits compared to this quarter a year ago. Since the release, the stock price is down nearly 20 points! As investors, this might just be the drop we've been waiting for. Also, there's something I wanted to ask you (my subscribers)... We need your help. Before I sign off today and to end the episode, learn how you can contribute to my new blog. Special thanks to David, Reuben, Rusty, Joe, Jack, and Rex... Other stocks mentioned: McEwen Mining (MUX), BlackBird Energy (BBI.V), Northern Dynasty (NAK), Gold Miners ETF (GDX), Amazon (AMZN), Schlumberger (SLB), Encana (ECA), GoPro (GPRO), FitBit (FIT), International Business Machines (IBM), Post Holdings (POST), Boeing (BA).    ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! I begin today's episode by covering one of the most talked about companies on Wall Street - Apple. Their earnings were just released, beating expectations across the board. And since the news, analysts' reactions have been overwhelmingly bullish. But I can't say I agree… And I'm not so sure about Apple's quarter being "dynamic" either. After doing some of my own digging, I've realized there are some underlying truths about Apple’s 2016 end results... catalysts' that no one else cares to mention. Year-over-year, earnings have only grown 2% - mostly influenced by buybacks and a favorable tax rate. Yes, they blew expectations out of the water. But how much were earnings estimates lowered? Thus far, I've had a pretty good track record on covering this tech giant... and considering all of the noise surrounding this story - I have to warn my listeners. So, before my guest signs on, I'll be explaining why I'm not buying into all of the hype. Then, for today's main segment… I'll be introducing listeners to a stock that should 100% - be on everyone’s radar. The following company has the potential to become the next "market dominator." And shares are still selling for under $1. That’s why I brought on today’s guest, Garth Braun - President and CEO of Blackbird Energy (BBI.V). Garth's Blackbird Energy was by far, in my opinion, the most impressive company at last week's Vancouver Resource Investment Conference - which hosted over 200 names in the sector. Garth has done the unthinkable. And I was sold in less than 5 minutes of talking to him… Garth has taken Blackbird from a small, speculative explorer - to a $300 Million dollar company. And unlike most junior's in the sector, they don't just have a stake in the ground... waiting for a price-tag or an industry-leader acquisition... They are actually drilling and producing some of the finest natural-gas condensate in the world - located smack in the middle of the Montney Formation - Canada's next big energy bet. "Over the last 18 months, some of the largest transactions in Canada, outside of the oil sands, have been located in this region." Industry leaders like Encana, Apache, Shell, and Sinopec now have holdings practically located in Blackbird's backyard. To make matters better, Garth was one of the first to discover this liquid-rich area. In 2014, he says, people considered this land as "moose pasture." But it doesn't stop there… Due to the low priced oil market, Garth's team has been determined to innovate. And as a result, Blackbird Energy has made significant advancements. They've cut costs "dramatically" with state of the art technology. And experts are calling their innovations "disruptive." Garth has clearly lead his company through an amazing transformation. Although the stock price is currently resting at 52-week highs, the recent jump has been well deserved. This is not meant to be a promotion. I truly believe this company has more upside potential than any other stock priced below $1. However, as we all know, rewards will come with risks. Stocks that are priced this low can still be very volatile - especially in the oil industry. So I’m urging all listeners to do their own research. Still, Blackbird’s story is one you don’t want to miss. And finally, for today's Educational Segment, we're throwing stocks, finance, and economics out the door. I will be making one of boldest bets all year.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode… To start off today’s stream of questions, I explain to listeners one of the biggest misconceptions in investing. The key to investing in any stock (not just the ones I recommend) comes down to just one simple trick - patience. Many listeners have learned the hard way so I wanted to fully address this once and for all. Its extremely important that investors take their time on placing their bets. Meaning, if you do believe in a stock's long-term position, don't make a FULL investment all on the same day. Tune in as I explain how this strategy is one of the best ways to avoid volatility in the markets. I guarantee your returns will see better results. I then revisit my position on a stock that's been beaten down tremendously. This stock was considered "the darling" of the biotech industry a little over a year ago. It went from being loved by analysts across the board, to now - hated. I’ll be explaining why this biotech pioneer has the potential to rebound over the next 12 to 18 months. Moving on to the next question, I talk about one of today’s biggest trends - Marijuana. David, a Colorado local, says the marijuana industry is booming and asks if now is the perfect time to invest... I couldn’t disagree anymore. If you own any marijuana stocks, be sure to listen as I break down the sector. Although we’ve seen a recent run-up in stock prices, I believe the industry will continue to face huge headwinds. These stocks are simply trades… NOT investments. And finally, to end the episode, it's Nike (NKE) vs. Under Armour (UA). Tune in as I pick my favorite out of the two for 2017. Other topics include: A sneak peek for next week's Wall Street Unplugged with CEO of BlackBird Energy, KKR's future earnings, and whether it’s too late to get in on Northern Dynasty (NAK). Special thanks to Roland, Brandon, Matt, David, Dave, Nate, and Steve. Keep the questions coming!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! It's only January, but if you've followed me for the past few weeks, you've come to realize how important this month really is. I covered one key conference (CES2017) a couple weeks ago. And on today's episode, I have two more coming for you. It's a lot of information in only just a few weeks but bare with me... Each of these conferences come with game-changing announcements. To start, let’s go over what a difference a year makes... Donald Trump is now in office, and the bull market continues to get stronger. In fact, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit over 20,000 for the first time this week! This “Trump rally” has been strong for investors in every sector… except for one - Biotech. That’s why I invited Marc… Marc is Chief Income Strategist at the Oxford Club, Editor of the Oxford Income Letter and host of the Oxford Club Radio podcast. He just got back from the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. For those not familiar, the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference its like the Superbowl for healthcare, biotech, and pharmaceuticals. To start off the interview, Marc gives us his takeaways from the event. As Marc explains, the biotech sector has recently been facing a ton of headwinds. The sector currently faces a slew of new regulations as new administration takes the reigns. And in return, the biotech sector got a bit more complex. Although times are rough today, Marc breaks down his opportunistic outlook for the sector going forward. Investors must be patient as we are still in the "early innings" of biotech treatment Marc says. However, he adds that the demand for this sector will explode relatively soon. Together, we then break down the trends and stocks that are going to have the highest impact on the sector. These trends include big data and DNA sequencing. Also, before Marc signs off, he shares with us his favorite growth & income stock outside of the biotech sector. Then, for today's Educational Segment [39:31], I break down my visit to the Vancouver Resource Investment Conference - the largest junior mining conference in the world. The host and close friend, Marin Katusa, invited me to speak at the event. This is where it gets interesting… Out of the 5,000 people at this conference, not one person seemed to be bearish on the resource sector. What does that mean? ...It means I'm nervous. Let's not forget... Only 1 in 3,000 projects go from early stage development to actual production. To make matters worse, some of these stocks are already up 100%-300% from their lows yet people are still doubling their positions! But it's not all bad news. Although about 90% of these companies are terrible long-term investments, a few CEO's I met with were far from bluffing. Tune in as I introduce listeners to the few stocks that caught my attention. One is a stock that could potentially be the next Northern Dynasty!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking. Today's stream of questions start with one concerning a stock I recommended over a year ago - Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co (CTO). Odds are - you've never heard of this company. The business is boring. And you won't find much news on it. But I've seen this company grow firsthand - practically in my own backyard. One year later, I still see upside potential. Tune in as I break down the details... Also, my newsletter, Curzio Venture Opportunities, is approaching just its fourth month since launching in November. And it’s been a wild ride ever since. However, I've been recently getting tons of questions on how to access the newsletter. Well, for those interested, I'll be giving away everything you need to know on how to join. But I'll warn you... Not everyone is qualified. And if the price is too high, please, don't worry. I might of spoke too much already. But today I announce that we have something else in the works... My next question covers today’s main segment [17:16]. Since the Trump election, we’ve spent a lot of time focusing on a variety of small-caps. But there are stocks we simply cannot forget, regardless of new policies... Most of these companies have been around for decades. Whether the market is up or down, these management teams have been through it all. I can guarantee it. More importantly, markets are cyclical. Which means plenty of well-known, safe stocks are still out there - just weeks away from rebounding. Today I share a few names I have in mind. Other questions covered include; Northern Dynasty's (NAK) recent capital raise, the CES, and my formula for investing dangerous small-cap biotechs. Special thanks to Michael, Joel, Brian, Paul, and Greg. Keep the questions coming!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! This week I’m joined by Amir Adnani – CEO of Uranium Energy Corp. & GoldMining Inc. (formerly known as Brazil Resources) On today’s show, Amir and I dive into one of the biggest topics in the markets right now – Uranium. If you own any Uranium stocks, or you’re thinking about buying, this is a must-listen. Because for the first time in years, a new dawn for nuclear power is finally approaching. To start off the interview, Amir gives listeners 3 reasons why the “perfect storm” is on its way. We’ve already seen a swing in prices and Uranium is trading at levels not seen since 2004. But let’s not get too ahead of ourselves. Amir explains why investors must be patient. If you haven’t bought into Uranium yet, don’t worry. Although all signs are pointing upward, he say’s companies are still in “no man’s land” – with current Uranium prices sitting at just $22/lb. The point is, however, the Uranium market is finally coming off it’s lows. And we don’t expect prices to return anytime soon. The turnaround is real. And demand expectations are promising… After all, the number of reactors under construction world-wide are at record levels! Tune in to hear everything you need to know about the sector. Amir and I then dive into a stock listeners should be very familiar with – GoldMining (BRI.V). Yes, we’ve seen Gold take an unexpected hit since the Presidential election… but that doesn’t mean investors should run. To end the episode, Amir reassures his investors. He explains how his company, GoldMining, plans to keep building on top of an already strong, overlooked balance sheet. And finally, I move on to my educational segment [54:33]. Sector by sector, I’ll be breaking down this upcoming earnings season. Let’s just say this – Don’t be fooled by analyst estimates, they’re outrageous…]]></description>

Sector by sector, I’ll be breaking down this upcoming earnings season. Let’s just say this – Don’t be fooled by analyst estimates, they’re outrageous…]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! With all the noise surrounding the internet these days, it's difficult to find a good financial research platform. And as some listeners have noticed, Yahoo Finance is not what it was 5 years ago. To start off today's episode, I give listeners a list of my favorite online financial sites... Sites I generally use for my own research. Some come with a cost and some are free, however, each of these sites have their own strength. Remember, this podcast is about you, not me. I highly recommend you check them out. Then, my next question covers a stock I am getting tons of feedback on - KKR & Co. LP (KKR). I recommended this stock just two weeks ago on my educational segment. And since then, it appears many subscribers are hesitant or concerned. Today, I'll be jumping back into the numbers - and will explain why there's still massive upside potential. Also... I can't win them all. A couple months ago I made a mistake. I recommended a retailer just as the holiday season was picking up. And since then, the brick & mortar sector has been crushed. I'll admit my losses. However, I still believe this particular company is in way better shape than its competitors. Although I'm expecting a little more "pain" in the short-term, I still love their long-term position. Switching gears, I then dive into the uranium sector. Prices have finally reached over $20/lb. In fact, uranium is trading at prices not seen since 2004. What does this mean going forward? To end the episode, I revisit a few more stocks on my radar. This includes Delta Airlines (DAL), Amazon (AMZN), and Northern Dynasty (NAK). Special thanks to Kurt, Scott, Christopher, Kris, Daniel, and John. Other stocks mentioned: Cameco (CCJ), Uranium Energy Corp (UEC), Skyharbour Resources (SYH.V), Uranium Resources (URRE), Stratasys (SSYS) Good Investing, Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! I just got back from the 2017 Consumer Electronic Show... and we have a lot of ground to cover. To start off today's episode, I give listeners my take on the event. This year's experience was a bit different. In fact, there are more trends to avoid rather than trends to invest in. Tune in this week as I'll be separating the truth from all the noise. I'm then joined by the one and only, Marin Katusa - founder of Katusa Research. There's been a lot of tech-talk recently, but let's not get caught up in just one sector. With the annual Vancouver Resource Investment Conference just two weeks away, Marin is here to give listeners a sneak-peek. Also, he catches us up to date within the gold, silver, and uranium markets. Even with the dollar strengthening, we've seen a slight rebound in these sectors. What does this mean going forward? Well, let us hear from the best as Marin shares his 2017 outlook. Then, to end the episode, Marin talks about his most successful discovery last year. He claims it as the "world's largest undeveloped copper & gold mine." Its the stuff of legends... And thanks to Marin, I gave listeners a stock that has grown over 300% since recommending it - just 6 months ago! As you'll hear, this stock is dirt-cheap yet still holds massive growth potential.]]></description>

At times investments fall out-of-favor... and we are forced to sell. It happens to everyone. But what should investors look for when they want to re-enter? Then, after giving listeners a quick update on the uranium company - Cameco (CCJ)... I explain why dividend-cuts are not always necessarily a bad sign for shareholders. Switching gears, I then share some tips for listeners who are new to the world of investing. If you plan on being a "day-trader," this is a must listen. And finally, to end the episode, I break-down another "buy" recommendation. And why investors should act now - before the storm. Special thanks to Kevin, Daniel, Thomas, Mike, and John. Keep the questions coming! Other stocks mentioned: GoldMining (BRI.V), Sandstorm Gold (SAND), Kinder Morgan (KMI), KKR & Co L.P. (KKR), Delta Airlines (DAL), and International Business Machines (IBM) Also, don't forget to tune-in next week! I'll be recapping everything I learned from the 2017 Consumer Electronic Show. Talk to you then and good investing! Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! Today's guest is Steve Koomar - former derivative trader at Goldman Sachs and editor of the Vigilante Investor newsletter. He called it... Last time Steve was on the show, he explained why fears of a U.S. economic collapse were completely overblown. In addition, he told listeners that the natural gas sector was a sure bet. Here we are 5 months later... Natural gas has surged and the US stock market is sitting near all-time highs. Whenever Steve talks, I listen. And every time he gets on the show I learn something new. On today's episode, Steve starts off by giving listeners his updated economic outlook. He believes short-term market expectations are "unrealistic." However, he is still incredibly bullish on U.S. investments in the long-run. Steve also revisits his positions in natural gas, uranium, and farmland. And then shares his top picks within these sectors. These are safe and diversified investments that define his balanced approach. Then, on my educational segment, I'll be talking about one of the most overlooked stocks today. A lot has changed within the company in the past couple years. And today - I'm giving listeners a full break-down. Not only does this stock have huge growth potential, it has a single-digit P/E ratio, a 4% yield, and is dirt cheap. So don't sign off when Steve leaves us. To end the episode, I tell listeners my favorite growth and income stock for the new year. This is a strong buy... PS - It's finally here... Right now I am at the 2017 Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas. I've been posting live updates on my Twitter & Facebook accounts. Don't miss a beat.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! Today's show opens up with talks about the transportation and logistics markets. The numbers show Amazon (AMZN) is now a logistics titan - with still plenty of room for growth. Tune in to hear what this means for competitors like FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS). I then touch base on Apple's (AAPL) political landscape. Let me tell you - "What they say and what they do are two totally different things." Today's show covers Apple's only risk investors need to be aware of. In addition, I break down the top 3 financial stories from 2016. Each story comes with a lesson we must carryover into the new year. This includes lessons from consumer sentiment, the Trump election, and today's volatility. To end the episode, I tell listeners why 2017 should be a turnaround year for Uranium. This is one of my favorite plays for the new year. Also, can Northern Dynasty (NAK) get any higher? Special thanks to Tom, John, Derek, and Brad. 2016 has been one for the books. Thanks for tuning in and for all the great questions. Keep them coming! I read them all. Other stocks mentioned: AT&T (T), General Electric (GE), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), McDonalds (MCD), Wal-Mart (WMT), Nike (NKE), Kinder Morgan (KMI), IBM (IBM), Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), and Chipotle (CMG). PS - Be sure to follow me next week on Twitter. As mentioned, I have media access to the 2017 CES. Don't miss a beat. See you next year!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Happy Holidays and welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! You don’t have to be tech savvy to understand my next bet… And with the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show just around the corner, I couldn’t have timed this podcast any better. In fact, this is the rant I’ve been waiting for… Every January the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) presents the world with the latest and greatest tech trends. It’s considered the largest consumer expo in the world. And for good reason… The CES is the host of nearly 4,000 technology companies… The space covers 2.2M square feet… And it takes me about half the day to walk through the entire event. From an investor stand point – this is the opportunity to witness these trends on the launch pad, firsthand. And investing in the right stocks within these megatrends can result in massive gains. But here’s the thing. The trick to investing in this sector is all about knowing which trends to avoid… There’s one vital question we all must ask ourselves before we place our bets. “Do these tech-trends actually serve a consumer need?” If consumer adaptability is far out of reach. And if earnings are already dropping – As investors, why aren’t we looking elsewhere? To start off today’s episode, I’ll be diving in on 3 tech trends every investor must avoid. I have the numbers to back it up. Then, tune in to hear the ideas I actually do believe in. These new technologies are already implemented by the biggest names in the industry. Listeners will hear examples of each trend and how they can directly impact the consumer. Get your pens ready. To end the episode, I’ll be sharing the best plays in the sector – A list of stocks that have already secured their seat for the future.]]></description>

Although the stock has seen a recent drop in price, I tell listeners that we must respect the trend. As a junior minor stock, this is typical... and I'm not too worried.  Listen in as I explain why the numbers behind GoldMining are still favorable. I assure you, the sell-off has nothing to do with the individual stock.  Special thanks to Steven, Bruce, Pete, and Jerry]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! The 2017 Consumer Electronics show is finally just two weeks away. If you are not familiar, this is an event that sets the tone for the entire tech-sector... An event where the world's most innovative technology meets the consumer... And an event that investors cannot miss. Before today's guest signs on, I'll be giving listeners an exclusive sneak-peek. The announcements of these "exponential growth technologies" create once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. Which means, as investors, we must catch on to these trends early - before they disrupt the markets. Tune in as I name a few trends I expect to see in every household within the next three to five years. Then, for today's main segment, I'm joined by longtime friend, Meb Faber - best selling author, entrepreneur, and Chief Investment Officer/ Portfolio Manager at Cambria Investment Management. The dollar is surging, the market continues to hit all-time highs, and we've seen one of the longest lasting bull markets in decades... Meb is a numbers guy. A research junkie. His evaluation methodologies are far from the norm... He calls it the Shiller CAPE ratio. Not only does he claim future expected returns are going to be lowered, he has the numbers to prove it. The markets are getting more expensive. And as a result, the chances of finding "cheap uptrends" are getting slimmer. As Meb explains, investors need to take a step back... "Every investor should have at least half of their stocks outside the US" he says. Using the CAPE ratio, Meb has managed to find a couple markets that have the "cheap upside" investors are looking for. Tune in to hear what they are... Then, to sum up the episode, Meb gives listeners his 3 steps to the ideal, global market portfolio. The time is now... we must start looking for alternatives]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! Special thanks to Brain, Jeff, Kenny, Craig, and Steve for all the great questions. On today's show, I open up by breaking down the small-cap biotech sector. Jeff provides listeners with a perfect example of a biotech stock fighting for FDA approval. I've seen this happen too many times... From the pre-clinical stages... all the way through the approval process... these companies undertake extreme volatility. Step-by-step, I explain the lengthy process every small-cap biotech company must endure. In addition, I tell listeners exactly when it's the best time to place their bets on these types of investments. Then, after revisiting my position on Northern Dynasty (NAK), I dive into a very important lesson... Stop-loss orders. This is an investment tool every investor must use in order to prevent large portfolio deficits. I often warn investors to not "show their hand"... Tune in to hear what I mean. Finally, to end the episode, I dive into another sector that has just about topped-out. With interest rates going higher, I tell listeners why I'm avoiding this market going forward. Other stocks mentioned include: Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK), Amgen (AMGN), & TherapeuticsMD (TXMD) Thanks for listening, Frank Curzio]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. This week I’m joined by John Petrides – Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Point View Wealth Management. On today’s episode, John and I look back at the major headlines from 2016. So much has happened… and as a result, we’ve witnessed one of the most volatile years in stock market history. John provides listeners with a step-by-step market review – leading us all the way to today’s rally. Oil prices hit 10-year lows… gold had its best 1st quarter in 30 years… “macro” events like Brexit, and the Election – all have had their place in this years economic roller-coaster. As investors, there are many lessons we must carry-over into the new year. Tune in to hear why John and I are approaching 2017 much differently than last year. Also, It’s about time… The Fed finally raised interest rates – squeezing in one hike in a year that was supposed to have four. What now? As John says, the biggest question lies behind the “language” of the Fed going forward. He explains why investors need to be cautious if interest rates rise faster than expected. Switching gears, John shares with us the biggest post-election headwind for several S&P 500 companies. A tax reform is on it’s way… but that does not mean these stocks are off the hook. This is why I love bringing John on the show. He can give listeners insight on just about any topic. To end the episode, John gets on a roll – giving his outlook on a wealth of sectors. This includes one sector that has been completely overblown… And another that hasn’t traded this cheap since 2009.]]></description>

To start off the episode, I tell listeners why I'm still bullish on Sandstorm Gold (SAND). Although the price of gold continues to fall, I don't think CEO Nolan Watson is too concerned. Tune in to hear why I think the stock could still double in the next three to six months. I'll also be revisiting my outlook on the Uranium markets. Uranium is at all-time lows, however, our new President may be the catalyst we've been waiting for. I'll be explaining the safest Uranium play going forward. Then, later in the episode, I'll be comparing some popular investment strategies. This includes individual stocks, ETF's, and mutual funds. Also, I give listeners updates on a couple stocks I like - AT&T (T), and Delta (DAL). Other stocks mentioned include: Pioneer Energy (PES), General Electric (GE), Uranium Resources (URRE), & Cameco (CCJ).]]></description>

If you don’t know Richard, he is often seen on Forbes and TheStreet.com. He is the Founder & CEO of Global Market Consultants.  To start off the interview, Richard warns any investors chasing the recent Trump rally. Although certain sectors remain "tradable" - Richard explains why most are not long-term investments.  Tune in and discover the ugly truth about this upcoming year. And why investors should take their profits now... before it's too late.  Richard then takes us a step further. He breaks down what he calls the "balance sheet of the US economy." His latest victim? US banks. Aside from the too big to fail problems, Richard shares with us the various risks banks are still exposed to.  Then, on my Educational Segment [40:01], I'll be teaching listeners my most important lesson about the markets - Investor Sentiment. Considering today's economic environment, I couldn't have timed this any better. I'm afraid of a massive stock market correction. Here's how to stay one step ahead.]]></description>

Kim is the definition of a world traveler. His boots-on-the-ground approach is unique. He's visited over 100 countries and has experience working on several stock exchanges. His new focus? Asia. Kim does not only provide listeners with information - he delivers insight. Most investors are afraid to invest in oversea markets... Debt levels are increasing, real-estate bubbles are looming, and thanks to Trump, trade barriers are now strengthening. But more importantly, investors rarely hear the real story behind these markets - until now. And as Kim highlights, there is still plenty of room for growth. Tune in as Kim shows us how the individual investor can conquer the emerging markets - safely. These are opportunities you won't hear anywhere else. Also, don't miss out on this week's Educational Segment. Several sectors are poised for big changes due to the upcoming tax reform. But enough with the general "macro" economic outlooks. Instead, I'll be telling you what this means for several individual companies. Write these stocks down. I'm expecting HUGE gains.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Happy Thanksgiving! Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. On today’s episode I’m joined by good friend, Andrew Horowitz – Founder and CEO of Horowitz and Company. The anticipation of new policies are causing massive market swings – but how long will this trend last? To start off the episode, Andrew highlights several grossly, over-anticipated sectors. As the market is coming off record highs, Andrew explains why our portfolios are at even greater risk. Recent trends are far from the truth. Tune in as Andrew and I discuss what an inevitable high interest rate environment means for certain sectors going forward. Andrew then shows listeners how to take advantage of the crazy market jumps we are witnessing today. These are aggressive, short-term trading positions that could potentially move 100% to 200% within the next few weeks. And finally, let the holiday shopping begin! As online-shopping trends continue to grow, Andrew breaks down which big-box retailers to avoid this season.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! Listeners, your portfolio may be in danger. The chances of rate hikes are getting significantly stronger - but will this actually help our economy? Before my guest signs on, I'll be giving investors my thoughts on the next "black swan" event. You heard it here first. Then, for today's show, I'm joined by Jordan Trimble - President and CEO of Skyharbour Resources. Jordan and I talk about one sector that will soon face huge tailwinds now that Trump is president. Due to depressed prices, however, investors must be patient. Nobody (including industry leaders) can even make profits right now. But as Jordan explains, this sector is poised for a HUGE turnaround in 2017 - leaving investors with an extremely rare opportunity. Also, I just got back from the 2016 Silver & Gold Summit in San Francisco - where I spoke and met with some of the world’s top precious metals investors and entrepreneurs. For those that couldn't attend... I'm here to bring you everything you missed for this week's Educational Segment [50:20]. This includes a few companies that should be on everyone's radar. As well as a sector that flat-out has too much hype.]]></description>

Our economic environment has radically changed overnight - and I'm here to break-down what this means for every sector going forward. I'll try my best to avoid anymore political discussion. Instead, on today's segment, we'll be talking about whats important - your portfolio. My guest this week is Nick Hodge - founder and President of the Outsider Club, and investment director of Early Advantage. One thing is clear... the resource bear market is coming to a close. And as Nick explains, opportunities are arising "across-the-board." Nick shares with us his strategy of buying some of the highest-yielding resources at dirt cheap prices. To end the episode, Nick gives listeners his favorite stock ideas. This includes four buy-recommendations every resource stock investor needs to be aware of.]]></description>

Today I'm joined by the No. 1 credit strategist in the world, Michael Lewitt. Michael is the editor of the Money Map Press investment advisory, Zenith Trading Circle. Michael starts off the interview by telling us why we are in a political crisis. With the election just one week away, Michael explains how the market has been in a completely "un-parallel" universe...  breaking down why investors have been fooling themselves this whole time. Then, giving us numbers no one else is talking about, Michael dives into the policies surrounding corporate America. This is capitalism upside-down. Michael shows us how companies are disguising investors everyday. Tune-in as he names a few over-looked sectors facing dangerous headwinds going forward. You see, Michael is not your average analyst. He is a best-selling author and has decades of experience focusing on the economy's unstable environment. His multi-dimensional strategy gives investors insights you simply don't hear on mainstream media. To end the episode, Michael gives us details on his own unique investing model. Step-by-step, he unfolds his strategy behind discovering the next bankrupt company.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! On today’s interview I bring back the most connected expert in the mining industry – founder of Katusa Research, Marin Katusa. Before Marin joins us, however, the episode begins with this week’s Educational Segment. The recent AT&T-Time Warner deal has the potential to bring the biggest trends in the world under one umbrella. Forget what the all the analysts are saying… as I explain why I’ll soon be adding more stock to my current position. Then, stay tuned as I’m joined by resource legend, Marin Katusa. As he puts it, the gold “trend is our friend.” After years of setbacks, Marin talks about how major gold producers are finally in position for growth. Switching gears, Marin then dives into the future of alternative energy. He explains how the sector has changed significantly… and what these new technologies mean for investors going forward. To end the interview, Marin and I discuss the evolution of personal finance. Investors don’t need typical brokers anymore… or huge investment banks either. Ordinary investors now have opportunities to privately invest with the biggest names in the industry – at the same price. Listen-in as Marin shares his experiences to prove it. Also, after Marin signs off, I give listeners a bit more details on my newsletter [1:00:50]. Mark your calendars… the launch is THIS Saturday! The moment we’ve all been waiting for is finally here.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! Our guest this week is the single best gold-stock analyst I know, John Doody. He is the editor for the now-famous Gold Stock Analyst Newsletter. To start off the interview, John and I talk about gold's biggest misconception. The truth is, we do NOT know what the price of gold will be going forward. However, after recent pullbacks, John reassures investors by giving us the big picture. He explains how one "inevitable" key factor will ultimately drive the price of gold... and that nothing else we hear matters. John's "old-school" mentality is one of a kind. He is a fundamentalist. He tells listeners how to protect their savings, and as you will hear, its not only about gold. Later in the episode, John breaks down his secrets to finding the world's most undervalued mining stocks. His analysis includes the biggest names in the industry, junior miners, and the "least risky" business models to invest in. I don't say this often, but I believe we're on the brink of a once-in-a-decade opportunity.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to Wall Street Unplugged! This week's episode is a special one. A lot of ground is covered as I have, not one... but two separate interviews. I am first joined by CEO Greg Smith. Listen in as Greg introduces his company, JDL Gold Corp., and explains how they have the recipe to become next "superstar" in the mining industry. After just their first week of trading, Greg talks about the company's future plans and projects going forward. This is not your typical mining company... and apart from the insiders, not many people have heard of it. However, JDL Gold might have the greatest shareholder base I have ever seen in the industry. Just wait until you hear this list... Our second guest is current managing director & portfolio manager at Point View Wealth Management, John Petrides [40:45]. As we enter earnings season, John and I talk about recent stock evaluations. At one point, John compares today's market to 2008! After six straight quarters of negative earnings growth, John shares his thoughts on these ridiculous consensus expectations. Then, to end the episode, John and I break down a few stock picks. This includes one of the worlds largest tech company, and a retailer that should be on everyone's radar.]]></description>

On today's interview, Kristin gives listeners an interesting refresher on the retail markets. The 30-year retail veteran gives her "ahead of trend" analysis on what to expect as the holiday season is approaching. She explains why investors should take action now as companies are currently positioning themselves for their most important quarter. Kristin then talks about the shift of competition in the retail markets. These days, consumer spending and shopping trends are always changing. Kristin shares her thoughts on what sectors in the industry are "too little, too late" compared to those that are moving in the right direction. On today's Educational Segment I'll be breaking down last week's Delivering Alpha Conference. This is where the greatest asset-managers in the world get together to share their ideas and forecasts. Not only did I get front-row seats, I was the only newsletter writer in attendance. Stay tuned after the interview to find out what was being discussed behind the scenes... when the cameras weren't on. You won't get this information anywhere else.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Our guest this week is founder and chairman of Brazil Resources, Amir Adnani. As we enter the early stages of a likely precious-metal bull market, few are more prepared than Amir. His company, Brazil Resources, has grown over 400% just this past year. On today's episode, Amir gives us some reassuring factors for this upcoming quarter and explains why investors have yet to miss the boat. Amir shares with us how Brazil Resources has something that 99% of other developmental-gold companies don't have. He then breaks down Brazil Resources recent 'under-the-radar' acquisition which expects to bring a massive 40% asset-base increase.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our guest this week is founder and chairman of Brazil Resources, Amir Adnani. As we enter the early stages of a likely precious-metal bull market, few are more prepared than Amir. His company, Brazil Resources, has grown over 400% just this past year. On today's episode, Amir gives us some reassuring factors for this upcoming quarter and explains why investors have yet to miss the boat. Amir shares with us how Brazil Resources has something that 99% of other developmental-gold companies don't have. He then breaks down Brazil Resources recent 'under-the-radar' acquisition which expects to bring a massive 40% asset-base increase.

			<description><![CDATA[Today I have another special interview with longtime friend, Marin Katusa, founder of Katusa Research. Marin starts off this episode by giving us his outlook concerning the gold and silver markets. Marin shares his thoughts on how to navigate through this tough sector, giving us details on what to look for while these stocks are still in their early stages. Marin then gives us his insight on where gold prices are going to be in the next three to five years based on just two fundamental aspects. He then talks about "smart money" and his experience with warrants and why every accredited investor should be aware of these opportunities. Finally, Marin shares some interesting ideas on what to look forward to in other commodity sectors aside from gold and silver. These are sectors that not everyone will agree with, but potentially have tremendous upside in the near future. Don’t miss out on this week’s exclusive educational segment covering the popular short sale of First Majestic Silver (AG). By the end of this segment, you'll know what direction to take.]]></description>

He then explains the fundamentals behind owing warrants.  He says this practice is great for investors but not always good for companies who issue long-term warrants.   Jeff also breaks down the huge risks of owning small resource stocks since most companies will never see their signature projects go into production.  He believes these risks are sometimes overlooked by speculative investors - especially during bull markets like the one we are seeing today.   Finally, Jeff shares his three favorite junior mining ideas.  He says each name has incredible upside potential if gold and silver prices continue moving higher over the next few years. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Cactus Schroeder, founder of Chisholm Exploration and oil veteran who has been drilling wells in Texas for more than 40-years, shares his thoughts about the current state of the oil market and where he believes prices are headed over the next few years. He also gives us an insider perspective on how much drilling is actually taking place in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin right now...  The new technologies companies are using to lower their cost of production... And which large-cap companies are aggressively acquiring shale assets in Texas. Cactus then talks about the "real" breakeven price for shale producers - since it's a lot higher than the $50 a barrel breakeven price that is often talked about in the media.  He sees more pain specifically for oil services companies.  But also believes we could see plenty of more bankruptcies if oil prices remain below $55 a barrel. ]]></description>

Finance.  This includes reinventing the hedge fund industry.  Jeff says he may look to open up his own fund with a much better fee structure and much better returns.  But he's not promising anything-(although it does sound like Jeff is planning to open up a new fund in the near-term).  Jeff is one of the few analysts in the media who speaks his mind.  He doesn't care who he offends and always has conviction in every stock or sector he recommends.    So whether you agree with Jeff or not... you will know exactly where he stands on many issues after listening to this special interview.]]></description>

Casey and resource investing expert Marin
Katusa share the microphone in this exclusive Wall
Street Unplugged episode.  This is the first time ever
Doug and Marin have sat down to do a public interview together...
 And the advice they share during this Podcast is critical to
any investor who loves to speculate in the resource
sector.
Doug and Marin start off by sharing
their favorite junior mining ideas... They also talk about their
favorite commodity to invest in...  Who will be the "next"
superstars in the resource sector...  And they share a few
secrets to finding the best junior mining stocks that have
the potential to generate 1,000% returns or more for
investors.
Doug and Marin also let down their
guard.  They talk about why Marin no longer works for Casey
Research... They argue about who is the better poker player... Doug
shares his favorite (and unique) investment idea outside of the
resource sector... And Doug and Marin place a huge wager (in silver
coins) on who will be our next president come
November...
Frank says this is one of the best
Podcasts he's hosted in his over 10-year career of interviewing
market experts.  He also says this podcast is a must-listen-to
for anyone looking to generate big returns in junior mining
stocks.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The S&P 500 is off to its worst start in history.   Oil prices are near 12-year lows, the biotech sector is in freefall, and market leading stocks like Netflix, Facebook and Google are breaking down. The global markets are also falling. 
For investors, there is no shortage of negative news right now.  Most of this is "noise" being created by financial media outlets.  And this noise leads to fear and sometimes irrational decisions by investors.

			<description><![CDATA[Jeff Brown, editor of the Exponential Tech Investor newsletter and former head of divisions at tech giants Qualcomm and Juniper Networks, says it's the best time to invest in technology in 40 years. He breaks down the biggest trends in the industry including Big Data, Robotics and Cyber Security. 
Jeff then talks about the private equity (pre-IPO) market.  As an angel investor, he's more than doubled his money several times over by investing in the right area in technology at the right time. He highlights how it used to take a typical Fortune 500 company roughly 20 years to reach a $1 billion market-cap.  Today, it takes as little as three years for companies like Uber and Snapchat to achieve this milestone.   
Jeff explains how to invest in private companies. More important, he shares his favorite segments - within the private tech sector - that are seeing the most interest from multi-billion dollar venture funds.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Cactus Schroeder, Founder of Chisholm Exploration and oil veteran who has been drilling wells in Texas for more than 40-years, gives us an inside look at what's really taking place inside the Texas oil patch.
He explains how massive cap-ex cuts, an cutback in Saudi oil production, and the huge decline in drilling costs will eventually lead to higher oil prices. He also highlights why prices are much more vulnerable to an oil shock than ever before.
 Cactus then tells us how an old form a drilling is making a major comeback.  In fact, this type of drilling is profitable at much lower prices since drillers can increase the amount of oil recovered by 25% compared to fracking.  He believes this could be a game-changer in the industry. 
 Cactus is one of the smartest men you'll find in the oil business. He has had personal interests in over 1,000 drilling projects. He was also credited with finding one of the largest oil producing wells in the Eagle Ford in 2011 - which he later sold to Norway's Statoil for more than $1 billion.
 
If you are thinking of jumping back into oil stocks,be sure to listen to this interview first.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Marc Lichtenfeld, chief income strategist at the Oxford Club and editor of the Oxford Income Letter, shares a simple formula investors can use to determine if a dividend is safe.  This is important since many companies - notably in the energy sector - are suspending their dividends.  He also recommends two of his favorite dividend paying stocks to buy right now.  
Marc then explains why speculative stocks are suitable for almost any portfolio.  He shows investors - by using a four-rule system - how to find these potential 5-baggers without taking huge risks.  
 
Finally, Marc breaks down the biotech industry.  This is a sector of the market he's been covering for almost a decade.  Marc suggests investors should be buying biotech stocks on the recent pullback. However, he explains why one particular area within the sector should be avoided at all costs. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Ross Beaty, founder of Pan American Silver and 40-year mining expert, explains why investors need to be buying resource stocks right now.  He predicts gold and silver will be trading at much higher prices in just a few years.  This will push resource stocks extremely higher from depressed levels.  
Ross then talks about his latest renewable energy project called Alterra Power.  Alterra operates five power plants totaling more than 550 megawatts of generation capacity.    
He explains how the costs to produce solar, wind, hydro and geothermal energy have fallen drastically over the past few years.  This is why some of the biggest hedge funds, insurance companies and pension funds are pouring billions of dollars into alternative energy companies.  
 
Ross is considered one of the smartest mining executives in the world. He has a history of making his early investors very wealthy.  This Podcast is a "must-listen" for anyone looking to buy resource or alternative energy stocks.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Amir Adnani, CEO of Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSE: UEC) and world renowned uranium expert, gives us a glimpse of the huge potential that lies ahead for his uranium company. In a few years, he believes Uranium Energy could become the largest producer of uranium in America.
Amir also talks about how his company secured historical data dating back to the 1970's and 80's that show exactly where the largest uranium deposits can be found in America.
These deposits must get developed as America (the largest consumer of uranium) needs to find a domestic supply of uranium to power electricity.  
Finally, Amir breaks down how uranium is processed, packaged and shipped to its customers...  He highlights the domestic and international factors investors need to pay attention to before investing in uranium stocks...   And he explains why these factors will result in much higher uranium prices in the years ahead...
 
Frank says this Podcast is a "must-listened to" for anyone who wants to learn more about the uranium industry.  It's a depressed commodity (in a bear market much longer than gold and silver) that could offer investors huge returns once the cycle turns. In fact, this turn may have started already with uranium being one of the best performing sectors over the past two months.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Marin Katusa, resource expert and fund manager drops a couple of big bombshells here today as he shares his new plans.
He’s left Casey Research to start his own company Katusa Research and for the next two years he’s going to give away all his research for free.
There were no fallouts, no hard feelings and everyone is still great friends. Casey research has recently been bought (listen today to see who the buyer is) and the timing was just perfect for him to go out on his own.
He shares his secrets to finding the best junior mining stocks and dives deep into the huge potential in uranium companies.
There’s blood in the streets right now and if you have the stomach for it Marin says it’s time.
He talks about his biggest winners, why he has the best contacts in the resource industry and how's he's been able to make money during one of the most brutal downturns in decades.  
 
I’d urge you to sign up now for all his research and get one of the best educations in the junior resource industry, for free]]></description>

Frank then breaks down his recent call to buy General Electric.  The company made a major announcement to sell off its finance division and return $90 billion to investors over the next four years.  The stock responded with its biggest percentage gain in six years.  
 
Frank's subscribers are already up more than 10% on GE - just a few days after he recommended it in his Disruptors & Dominators newsletter. He will tell you why GE has much more upside ahead and how this company is a much better long-term stock for retirees - instead of McDonald's and Proctor & Gamble.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Keith Nuemeyer is a pioneer in the resource industry.  He's been investing, financing and managing companies in the resource industry for over three decades.  
He founded First Quantum Minerals in 1992.  He took the company from a penny stock and turned it into one of the largest copper producers in the world.  In 2002, he founded First Majestic Silver.  He took the company from a penny stock and also turned it into a multi-billion dollar producing giant.
Today, Keith is starting a new venture. It's called First Mining Financial.  The company just went public on Monday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  He is using his expertise to buy depressed mining assets all over the Americas. His goal is similar to Quantum and First Majestic... He wants to turn this small company into the next billion-dollar mining giant.  
Keith will talk about his new venture.  He will explain how he is able to buy mining assets at dirt cheap prices.  More important, he will show you how to be a successful investor since timing the commodities market is next to impossible.
 
This is a must-listened to interview for anyone who own a resource stock. ]]></description>

Frank then shows you how to buy stocks like Netflix, Apple and Celgene early in their growth phase.  These stocks traded at expensive valuations 10-years ago.
