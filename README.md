### Folder structure

```
├── PodcastSocial: Where my main React Native app resides
├── jsonserver: I used to use this folder to test APIs locally. Now, I've migrated to AsyncStorage and amplify APIs, so this folder is no longer needed. TODO: Delete this folder.
├── RecordAndEmail: Built quickly to test out a bug. Now, it's mainly used as a playground.
├── Screenshots: Folder to store screenshots of app to load to App Store
├── Sketch Files: Design files.
├── Sketch to Code: React Native files converted from Sketch. No longer used. TODO: delete
└── react-native: Another old project. TODO: delete
```
